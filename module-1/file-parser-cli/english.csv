"I ordered a PC from PCSPECIALIST, it took 24 working days for it to be built and delivered to my house, I expected some delay due to the chip shortages. Which I expected and accepted, build quality is amazing.
Only think I marked down for them is the communication, I expected for transparency regarding how long my gpu would of taken to be delivered or even a number in line. I hear alot of people say on here they got constant communication, I got zero unless I chased stuff up, the only communication i got that was when it was in QA and Delivery",positive,en
"This is a little swim shop on the corner of Maryland Parkway and Flamingo, next to Paymon's. It may not seem like a lot from the outside, but the inside is packed with everything a swimmer needs, from swimwear for men, women, and kids, to kick boards, goggles, pull buoys, swim caps, books, DVDs, and watches. They even have wetsuit rentals. I have found their prices to be cheaper than the sporting goods chains that sell swim stuff. Swim 2000 also has a huge online component where you can order online and then pick up your gear at the store to save shipping.

"It was nice to stay in this hotel because it's in a great location, it's a decent price, and the hotel itself is fun to wander around in. It's two blocks from the pikes market, and three blocks from the mall, about 8 blocks from museums and the needle. The rooms were ver clean, and though the note, is old it's well-kept. Everybody at the desk was extremely friendly and helpful!! There is wifi, but it doesn't work in most of the rooms. However there is a co pry, breezy lobby you can go to.
There are a few cons though. There is no AC, and there was one little window to open so you could barely get a breeze. I stayed in early September and it was decent at 80 degrees. It's just hard to get to sleep at night when it's so warm. The only other con is that there's no parking. They do have a deal with the Macy's parking structure. Block away though. 24 hours is usually 30 bucks, but it's only 12 with the voucher.
All in all it was a good experience!",positive,en
"This is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television. Season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons. The only reason that I give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the final season was the finale. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to people's imaginations, often depicting the characters in famous TV shows or movies from the 70's. It is a rare show in that i liked every character (with the exception of the final season...too late to try to develop a new character and fez wasn't nearly as funny). Red's foot in your ass comments never got old, nor did Kelso's stupidity. Bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long, too long even.",positive,en

"Any review depends what you pay for a room ‚Äì obviously if you pay $400 a night you are going to expect something different than a room in another hotel that goes for $200. This hotel is in the former category so the expectations are higher. This is also one of those hotels that if you are lucky enough to get a suite or a certain room you will enjoy it. Saying that, at our recent stay during the second weekend of August, we were not one of those lucky people. We got a room ending in ‚Äú03‚Äù.
We asked for one king bed and got two doubles. The room could not (or perhaps would not) be changed as there was a convention there that weekend. The room itself was small and crowded with furniture. The bathroom was very small. You could literally sit on the toilet, turn your head and tear off the toilet paper with your teeth. The door to the bathroom cleared the toilet by ¬º inch. One reason we stayed at this hotel was because all room were to have a mini-refrigerator where we could put our sodas, waters and left over snacks for middle of the night cravings. Well, it does but the ‚Äúmini-frig‚Äù is actually the in-room bar so it is already filled with the hotel‚Äôs sodas, liquors and candy. We did not want to move anything for fear of being charged when the bar inspector came by and found it missing. We were able to put in two small bottles of water only with great difficulty. I thought this was a cheat. The room itself is typical dull d√©cor and as stated earlier, overcrowded with furniture. The coffeemaker was in a very awkward position (sideways) and you could not move it because of the plug/outlet. You could not fill it with water all the way because of the strange location/angle.
Housekeeping was great in our case ‚Äì we had one of the absolutely best ladies cleaning and she was usually in and out of there by noon.
The food and drinks at the hotel are very expensive. A chicken Caesar salad had at the bar totaled (with all applicable taxes) $29.00. However, the bartenders were again some of the very best in New York City.
I travel to New York quite often and indeed I am a member of this hotel‚Äôs ‚ÄúPriority Club‚Äù but I would not stay there again. It is simply not worth the money. While in a very convenient location, there are a number of other hotels in the same 3-4 block radius.",positive,en
"I really don't understand why some people are complaining about this hotel! This hotel was wonderful! Some friend and I went here for the GA/FL football weekend and it was perfect for our situation. They were prepared for the event and had it decorated for both teams. :) I was honestly worried after reading some of these reviews before I went and I was pleasantly surprised! The hotel looks EXACTLY like the pictures (which is often not the case)! It was very clean, not smelly, the staff was great, and the continental breakfast had a huge selection! The only problem was the location. It was close to things, but you had to get on the highway again to get to the nearest food or fuel. Altogether, I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone else and would stay here over and over again if I had to!
Oh and its like 15 minutes from the beaches and maybe 7 miles from downtown Jacksonville...great place to be in between both places!",positive,en

"As soon as I walked into this place, my mouth began to water. The aroma in here just cant be beat.\n\nI ordered the special - 1 16\"" pizza with 2 toppings and 30 wings. Pizza toppings were Mushrooms and Onions. I lamented this topping combo, but it was what my girlfriend wanted. I got the wings hot, also ordered the Calzone sampler to try it out.\n\nWhen I opened the wing box, the steam that rose from the box made my eyes and nose water. It smelled so good I had to eat one right there at the counter. One of the owners told me that the wings are even better if you eat them in house. The next time I am in the area, I will try it out.\n\nI took the pizza home and cracked open the box. The mushrooms were thick, and the onions appeared at though they were cut by hand. The sauce was rich, and the crust was perfect.\n\nThe calzones were great as well, smothered in marinara sauce.\n\nThe price was great, the people were friendly. The lunch special can't be beat. (2 slices of pizza and a free soda, 50 cent refills)\n\nNegotiate the construction outside, find yourself a parking spot and get this pizza. My only regret was that I had to share it. Next time - its all mine.",positive,en

"I luckily found this place when I googled, \""Things to do in vegas.\"" Afterall, I'm really sick of doing generic activities in las vegas. Boozing and clubbing gets really old, and definitely not as interesting to do on a bday (at least for me). \n Since i wanted to do something fun, cool, that I had never done before on my birthday, I opted for playing in a so-called huge sandbox. Originally, I thought I was going to break, demolish and feel like Godzilla by being the mastermind behind the massive machinery. I was soon disappointed for a slight second when I found out I wasn't going to pick things up (was hoping a car...just kidding) and throwing it somewhere a couple feet away and smashing it. Oh wait, I'm not kidding about the car. \n Instead, I got to re-arrange tires, pick up a basketball and put it in a tire hole, and get to dig some deep holes. It was challenging and fun at the same time. If the DIG IT people are reading this, maybe the car idea isn't so bad after all. \n\n The owner was personable and friendly. The instructors were funny, patient, and an absolute delight to work with. Not only were they informative, but they were real pros that helped me get through the entire activity. I had an AWESOME time. \n I think the only disadvantage is the price. Luckily, I found a groupon to cut down costs, and it allowed both of us to share the experience together. I believe it usually costs about $220/pp for 1.5 hours. Not cheap, my friends. \n\n Given the choice between the EXCAVATOR and BULLDOZER, STICK WITH THE EXCAVATOR. Cuz you get to play with BALLS. HAHHAHAHAHHA...okay, okay, that too, and it's also much bigger than the bulldozer. Sometimes, size matters, and bigger is better. Even my bf (who did the bulldozer) said he wants to go back and try the excavator. As for me, once you go big, you can't go back...",positive,en

"10/10PLOT DISCUSSIONThis is one of the best movies ever made and I am not saying that because I am being fooled by the seemingly nonsensical presentation. Those who dislike the film because they don't understand the story often criticize those who are praising the film by saying that they are assuming its genius because they don't understand it. I don't view this movie as very allegorical. To me, it is a story with a beginning, middle and end. People become confused by the film because they expect it to have a deep, philosophical meaning that they are to interpret from the allegedly meaningless scenes. I feel they fail to realize that the crypticness comes from a chopped-up and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory. Because of the limitation of length, I will try to keep this short and to the point and touch on the major concepts.The general plot: Diane moves to L.A. after jitterbug contest to get into acting. At an audition, she meets Camilla with whom she falls in love. Diane becomes enraged with jealousy since Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (the director) at a film shoot and discovers the other woman (a random blond) at the engagement party for Camilla and the director. Motivated by her rage and possessiveness, Diane hires a hit man to kill Camilla. After that is done, she is overcome by loneliness and slips into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives the life she wants to. Diane is then awakened. In her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done.The significance of the fantasy: The film starts out, after the credits, with a 1st person p.o.v. shot depicting somebody collapsing onto a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. This is where Diane's fantasy starts. The accident is there as an excuse for her to ""bring back"" her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. She depicts her girlfriend as meek and innocent because that is what she wished she was. In the meantime, she acts like everything is ""like in the movies"" because she has an escapist personality. She also, in a sense, kills herself off and assumes the identity of a waitress named Betty at a diner. The story revolving around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in someway victimized in reality just as she was and ""convinces"" herself that he was forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades in the fantasy is actually the random blond from the engagement party. She hated her so much that she turned her into Camilla and made the ultimate antagonist. She then took the real Camilla and turned her into a perfect, submissive out-of-the-movies girlfriend and used Rita Hayworth as an inspiration. She also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify the survival of Camilla. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for Diane which ended up being herself and made the dreamworld die by taking her through a series of reminders of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio which chanted that ""there is no band"" and the ""instruments"" you hear are not really there; this is a metaphor for the fantasy. She begins to shake violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings. The other reminder is the blue box... Actually, the blue box is not the reminder itself (more of a Pandora's Box, really), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue key reminds her of the actual death of Camilla because it is what the hit man said would show up when it was done. Along with having love, this entire creation of hers is an escape from reality by living in the idealized Hollywood that she expected to be part of when she arrived. This is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who lost a dream. It is not series of random things specifically designed to disturb and it is not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate chunk of the human condition that is presented beautifully.However, ultimately this is all my opinion. I may be way off. Or it may not be intended to mean any one thing. There are many who disagree with me. Great! Afterall, why does it have to mean anything? Why can't it just be a statement in itself? What if coherent, sensible narratives are shackles for artistic expression? Peter Greenaway, for example, has spent many words eloquently supporting that idea by such statements as ""I would argue that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, don't be a film maker. Because I believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren't primarily to do with narrative."" And where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. ""I didn't understand it!"" So...? ""Mulholland Dr.,"" story or not, affects the viewers, harasses them, drags them, awes them, lulls them. The way it lends itself to interpretation is amazing. It never gets old. It never loses its luster. Its visuals are always effective and beautiful. It is cinematic perfection no matter what. Enjoy.",positive,en
"I first watched this film when I was a kid and is the only time in my life that I can remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in utter horror at one particular scene. I remembered it again with a disscusion with my uni friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of hesitation I might add (to my surprise I only found it on the web in the States when it was made in England!) When I watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same, of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too. This is in my opinon the SCARIEST film ever made, Hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit Pony and Trap (crap), pardon the pun. What is amazing though is the power of this film and at uni when watching this with about twenty of my associates I have never heard so many screams, blokes as well! Even the sight of the video brings the fear of God into me of that one particular scene, and left me feeling that I will never walk alone again in the dark!!!!",positive,en

When arriving at the hotel on 6/21, I realized this mistake...and did not have a room and a completely full capacity hotel. Chris D. at the front desk was the most compassionate and helpful employee I have ever encountered in my hotel stays (I travel 80% for my work). He sat me down, calmed me down, and began searching kayak to find me a place for the night. After looking, making numerous calls, out of some act of god a room was cancelled and I was able to stay at the hotel for the night.

"My friend and I have just stayed in New York for 4 days at the end of a 10 day stint in Boston.
I only half heartedly read Trip Advisor comments usually because you never know who writes them and, having met lots of pretentious people on my travels, you quickly realise that some folks want champagne service for lemonade prices!
Anyway, we booked up because it looked like a good deal, and it was. The rooms were sensibly priced (given the location and standard of accomodation). Then Hurricane Sandy hit.
Yes we lost the power to our room, and yes, the water supply went too. The service lift was kept working via a generator (as mentioned by the previous chump!) and the staff did as best they could.
Yes there was no hot food available, and yes the bar wasn't open. The city was in a state of emergency for God's sake - what do people expect! The loss of power was not the hotels fault as the power company switched off the transformers up to 39th Street to prevent further damage, which is unfortunately where the St Giles was.
The staff were amazing and our heart goes out to them because some of them were unable to get home themselves - they stayed working at the hotel for 3 days straight. Spare a thought for them eh!
Although all the members of the St Giles team were great, I have to say a particular thanks to Danny. He helped my friend with our luggage to the hire car place.
Nothing special I hear you say? On the contrary .... he bought it down three blocks through the worst traffic I've seen outside China and Bangkok!! We can;t thank you enough for that mate. You are a legend. Simple as that.
The fact is that a lot of New York (a couple of days later) was operating as normal, but like many people, the St Giles was a victim of the storm. It was a natural disaster and a state of emergency was declared. If people fail to appreciate this and have the gall to moan that the lifts were out, they really need to get their heads from up their own arses I think - the hotel is great and we'll definitely go back.
I'll leave you with an old persian proverb - think about it eh!

"This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film. I have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant--while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only movie I know of that has such polarized views based on gender. Perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots--but whatever the cause, I have always found this difference fascinating.The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future and the head of the huge international Soylent Corporation has been assassinated. As the film unfolds, you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future American society. The rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy(including ""furniture""--a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are dirt poor, unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways. Overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed! Why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with I really should NOT discuss--it could ruin the film for you. However, the film has a great plot and acting and is super-exciting to watch. Plus, it features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston. Though not for the easily depressed or squeamish, this is a great sci-fi film that is allegorical and profound.",positive,en

Smiling, eager to make the experience positive. Such a change from our flight over on United. We'd love to fly Singapore again.",positive,en
The hotel has large rooms which are nicely furnished and decorated. The rooms and the hotel itself offer any amenities one needs. In different places around the world Hilton offers the same at better prices but here you also pay for the location: You are right at Times Square; one step out and Manhatten is right in front of you. Really great. If I return to New York I will probably stay at this hotel again.,positive,en

"This hotel positions itself as being premier, so I think they hurt themselves by setting false expectations of grandeur. It is charming and is in a convenient location, but I don't know if that makes it worth the money for me. Firstly, we were told that there was only valet parking available, and then the attendant acted as though it was a huge inconvenience to park the car. He suggested that we find street parking, and when we declined he was visibly perturbed. We got to the room and the decor was lovely, but the AC did not cool the room. I understand that it is a historic building, but for $130/night they could seriously invest in some more fans or something. By the end of the night, I was rubbing cool washcloths on my forehead to beat the heat. In Hotel Lombardy's defense, I did not complain about the heat so I can't say whether they would have offered something or not. It was a nice experience, but I will definitely try somewhere different on my next trip to DC.",positive,en

"There are mixed reviews about this hotel, and I think it has to do with your expectation going in.
This hotel is fine for an overnight trip to the Inner Harbor. My husband and I stayed there, it is in a safe neighborhood, and there were always people walking to and from the Inner Harbor. If you feel unsafe in this neighborhood, you probably feel unsafe in any city.
The hotel staff was very caring. We stayed in the South Tower, which has been renovated. Again, the rooms are based on your expectations. If you are hoping for a luxe, spa-like room with lots of space, this is probably not your hotel. If you want a clean, decent space, it's great. I would probably be upset if I paid more than $100 a night for the hotel, but I didn't. I got the room on priceline.com.
We went to the pool. It was about 80 degrees outside. The pool was not heated. Water was a little too cold to enjoy. Yet we loved the ambiance of the pool, which makes you feel like you are in an urban oasis. It also had a grill and some great furniture.
We ate breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel. Not recommended.
Overall, it was a great place for a quick overnight trip. If you want a suite-like room, you probably need to find another place. We found it perfect for our needs, but we rarely spend a lot of time in our room when vacationing.",positive,en

"I don't doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Best Actor Oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the Mutiny on the Bounty leads of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton, and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race. But The Informer is still a fine film because John Ford wouldn't have gotten his first Best Director Oscar if it wasn't. No split involved in his award.The movie and the story by Liam O'Flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in. He's down to his last pence and if he can't get back in, wants enough for passage to America. There's a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan constabulary and informs on McPhillip.The IRA is pretty anxious to find out who ratted McPhillip out and they're pretty certain it was McLaglen. He hasn't the wit to really cover his own tracks. He does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek. He also picks up a hanger-on played by J.M. Kerrigan.The whole action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning. Of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows, making it possibly the first noir thriller. Had it been done post World War II The Informer would have ranked as a great noir classic, like Odd Man Out or the The Third Man which it bares a lot of resemblance to.John Ford knew this world very well. He took some time off during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before having it anglicized was Sean O'Fiernan.Preston Foster plays the IRA commandant Dan Gallagher. In the book Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has him here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest. He makes it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informer because the Black and Tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril.The IRA trial scene is the highlight of the film. When Foster asks Donald Meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court, Meek ain't in a position to say no. The King's justice and writ does not run here. It graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary, the British are indeed losing their grip on the population.Of course The Informer a rather grim story has its John Ford touches, but rather fewer than you would expect. Even as McLaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree, the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing.The Informer is a tale well told about Ireland in a grim and dismal time.",positive,en
"The beds were terrible - uncomfortable, poor quality, hard square pillows and no blanket, just a sheet and very thin cotton cover. Not even a bedspread to pull up for warmth (just a narrow cover over the end of the bed.) We stayed 2 nights, the first morning my husband realized not only was the bed uncomfortable, it was broken! In general the quality and maintenance is poor - remotes that don't work, sliding door handle dropped off, one room had a one-cup coffee pot with one-cup pods, the other room had a large coffee pot but still only one one-cup pod, so we had to call for more coffee. These are minor things, no big deal, but not what you would expect of a 3-star Wyndham, more like a cheap motel. In fairness, I would like to say that management and staff were just fine. The front desk kindly upgraded us to a small suite when I asked if they might have a fridge and microwave to prepare food for our 2 year old son. The manager responded immediately to the broken bed issue, told us we would be moved to a different room and we could do so in the afternoon when we returned from brunch. (We did that and although the front desk called for someone to help us move, no one showed up so we did it ourselves.) The $60 Hotwire rate was reasonable, I would not want to pay more for this property.",positive,en
"The true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way (note that this change need not be positive or beneficial) at the end.By that measure, Enchanted April is a resounding success. As a film in general, it succeeds quite well-excellent ensemble cast, well-developed characters you come to care about, wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations. In short the film is, well, enchanting. Although all the performances are first-rate, three must be mentioned-Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. It says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast. Most highly recommended, particularly if you are a romantic at heart.

"As a convert into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I try to absorb as much as I can of my new religion's history.

On a beautiful spring evening, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio to the church's historical village located there. We were to have had reservations at the Vistor's Center to view this movie. Since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries, I was intrigued. The only ""full length motion pictures"" of the church's I had seen was ""Legacy"" and ""My Best Two Years"", both which I thought were very well written and preformed.At the beginning, the missionary interpretor passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie.

"Estuvimos con mi familia durante 5 d√≠as en Enero de 2010,. Lo bueno de este Hotel es que est√° emplazado en el coraz√≥n de la isla de Manhattan, y estas equidistante de todas las atracciones de la ciudad con el Subway que tomas en la puerta del hotel. Respecto al hotel propiamente dicho les comento: que lo mejor que tiene es la habitaci√≥n compartimentada, es decir que tienes un dormitorio con una cama grande de dos plazas y un living con un sof√°-cama, que es ideal si vas con hijos. Posee un ba√±o realmente grande y un √°rea donde tienes una bacha para lavar menaje de ‚Äúcocina‚Äù, cafetera, horno microondas y una peque√±a heladera (refrigerador).
Esto es fant√°stico ya que puedes programar hacer tu propio desayuno en la habitaci√≥n, dado que los del hotel son muy caros y cualquier desayuno en bares y/o en MacDonals, no baja de u$s 10 /12 por persona.
Esta comodidad que te ofrece es rar√≠sima en la Ciudad de New York, que se caracteriza por habitaciones muy peque√±as y ba√±os diminutos y a lo sumo solo te colocan una cafetera.
Adem√°s posee un caja fuerte que programas vos mismo para poner tus valores, y tiene un tama√±o que incluso podes gardar tu laptop o notebook.
El servicio de habitaci√≥n es bueno y el servicio de mucamas tambi√©n, ya cuando vuelves de tu paseo por la ciudad encuentras la habitaci√≥n limpia y ordenada. Ademas posee una mesa-escritorio que se puede ampliar y dos TV de plasma de 42 pulgadas, una en la habitaci√≥n y otra en el living.
Hay que tener en cuenta algo, a la puerta del Hotel se encuentra Times Square, eso quiere decir que siempre tienes ruido, gritos y mucha gente (a la hora que sea), as√≠ que si buscas algo mas tranquilo‚Ä¶ elije otra zona de la ciudad. Pero como dije antes estas en el centro propiamente dicho de la isla. Estas a 10 cuadras del Central Park y a 8 de Macys, por lo tanto puedes ir caminando.
Secretos a la hora de reservar el Hotel: 1) Inscr√≠bete en el programa de la cadena (Hilton HHonors), y as√≠ conocer√°n tus gustos de habitaci√≥n de antemano (por ejemplo, lejos del ascensor, no fumador, pisos altos, etc.) ya que si tienen disponibilidad priorizan los mismos; 2) Paga y/o reserva la habitaci√≥n mas barata, ya que luego de la registraci√≥n y/o pago con tu tarjeta de cr√©dito te aparece la opci√≥n de un ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù de habitaci√≥n. Estas opciones comienzan en u$s 5 (que con mas los taxes e impuestos rondaran los 8). El sistema funciona as√≠: vos pagas y/o reservas la habitaci√≥n mas abarata y luego ped√≠s que te consideren un upgrade de existir disponibilidad al momento de arribo al hotel.
En nuestro caso pagu√© por adelantado una habitaci√≥n normal econ√≥mica (que son las que est√°n hasta el piso 4 o 5) y luego por esa poca diferencia me subieron al piso 33, con lo cual tienes una vista impresionante de la ciudad.
Como ‚Äòcontras‚Äô puedo comentar lo siguiente: 1) que el sistema de ‚Äúearly check in‚Äù es una verdadera porquer√≠a. Nosotros arribamos alrededor de las 10:00 AM y no pudimos ingresar a la habitaci√≥n hasta las 15:00 PM. A pesar de haber informado esta cuesti√≥n y no daba la sensaci√≥n que el Hotel estuviera ‚Äòa full‚Äô. Si bien nos tomaron las maletas y las colocaron en una bodega, esto no quita que tuvimos que esperar mas de 6 horas para ingresar, luego de un vuelo de 10 horas.
La otra contra es que el acceso Wi-Fi de Internet en la habitaci√≥n te lo cobran u$s 15 mas impuesto por d√≠a !!!, solo es gratuito en el Lobby del Hotel, pero tienes que tener un laptop con buenas bater√≠as, ya que solo hay tres enchufes de electricidad, as√≠ que si hay tres pasajeros utilizando esos enchufes, solo podr√°s utilizar el acceso a Internet gratis, el tiempo que te duren tus bater√≠as (que para una adolescente eso es un dolor de cabeza jajaja)
As√≠ que solo por estas dos ‚Äòcontras‚Äô no lo voy a calificar como ‚Äòexcelente‚Äô a este Hotel.
Por lo dem√°s‚Ä¶ volver√≠a a elegirlo incluso a recomendarlo.
Ah! me olvidaba‚Ä¶ las galletas de chocolate que te dan de bienvenida, son riqu√≠simas‚Ä¶ y un secreto‚Ä¶ nosotros cuando volv√≠amos al hotel al finalizar el d√≠a, ped√≠amos una para cada uno y las com√≠amos en el desayuno !!",positive,en
"Schwartz's was my first introduction to Montreal smoked meat and I must warn you - believe the hype, all of it. Internalize it and immerse yourself in the spicy, smoky goodness. \n\nThe meat is tender, tasty, and as fatty as you want it. The sandwiches are simple and for those of you who like it naked, I admire your reverence for the meat in it's native form. Otherwise, no whining about auto-mustard. If you are disappointed by the lack of other toppings, you are missing the point. It's all about the meat!!\n\nThe fries are a little on the soggy side, but again, you didn't come for the frites. However, be sure to grab a pickle and some peppers. They are super tasty.\n\nThe service was very good both times that I went, quick and courteous. There was even a little banter.

"This hotel ticked every box for us. Friendly, helpful staff. Quiet. Clean. Elegant but chic decor - lots of muted colors, dark wood, granite. (The only thing that didn't make sense was the glass panel on the bathroom door. It's frosted, but still awkward if you bring guests up for a drink. This is not an enormous problem, but something to be aware of when you use your room for potty breaks when you're hanging out with friends touring the city.) It's a little pricey, but this level of accommodations with all the extras - free continental breakfast (w/ hard boiled eggs), lemon ice water, tea & coffee in the lobby all day, happy hour menu, free wifi, 2 bottles of water at turn-down, gym pass (though I didn't use this) - are worth it. The rooftop bar is a fantastic spot for resting between activities. The staff up there are also wonderful. We were treated very well. We highly recommend and would stay again.",positive,en
"The hotels is typical on the surface of any large urban hotel near a convention center. It is adjacent to the convention center and close to St. Jude's.
Our first indication that the place was lacking was the parking issue. There is no parking except valet. You can park across the street in a church parking lot for $5 a day as your only option for self parking. Okay, parking is usually overpriced in these type of hotels.
On first glance the room is nice. Look closer, the wallpaper is peeling in the bathroom, the shower curtain has large faint rust colored stains on it. The toilet paper doesn't want to stay on the holder. The hair dryer in the closet works but is about 15 years old with worn off lettering and only 1600 watts. The white bed has some black smudged stains on it.
AND there is NO WIRELESS in the hotel. Come on, Super 8 can pull that off! I expected to have to pay a ridiculous price for what a cheap hotel provides for free - it is a Marriott after all but... NO WIRELESS. Rather you are tethered to the desk by a cord.
For the money, you should go elsewhere. My husband came late to the planning process for a conference in this hotel. I think they should have negotiated elsewhere - It isn't worth the price at all.",positive,en

It was nice to sit outside like we were at a cafe! The wait here can get pretty long, but I guess it also depends on where you want to sit, and how many people are you in your party.

L'albergo √® situato all'angolo tra Wall St e Water St, nel cuore del financial district, a pochissimi minuti a piedi da almeno 4 fermate di metro: Wall St (linee 2+3), Broad ST (linee J+Z), Whitehall St. South Ferry (linea R) e South Ferry (linea 1). Le camere sono spaziose, pulite, tranquille e confortevoli, con incluso WiFi gratis. Unica pecca per noi italiani: il bagno, pure ampio, non ha il bidet. L'albergo ha sala fitness ampia e bene attrezzata. Personalmente ho trovato un eccellente rapporto qualit√†/prezzo. Lo consiglio vivamente.",positive,en
"This is my third Vegas trip in a row visiting Comme Ca. It's pretty much become one of my default stops in Vegas that I simply just can't avoid and it's really hard for me to resist coming here for lunch.\n\nMy last two visits simply just had me order their famous Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll and call it a day. Well, that didn't stop here with this visit. But unlike those two visits before, I came with a bigger appetite and I ordered the their Oxtail Eggs Benedict as my main entree.\n\nDuck Confit Cinnamon Roll with Pork Belly -- <url> smoked bacon frosting, raspberry compote\nThis is one of those dishes that seem to get better every time I have it, even for the third time. Like before, it's really hard to explain in words how amazing this thing is. Sweetness from the cinnamon roll and raspberries, savory duck confit inside, and smokey flavor of the pork belly. Oh, and there's Bacon Frosting too! It's really not fair that I have to fly to another state to have this. A must order every time!! \n\nOxtail Eggs Benedict -- <url> warm goug\u00e8res, spinach, two poached eggs, truffle hollandaise\nAre you kidding me? This is definitely a great savory contrast to the sweetness of Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll. There's a lot going on with this Eggs Benedict because of the braised oxtail and the truffle hollandaise. It's oozing with flavor and has a lot of substance. This is food porn at its finest. One of the best Eggs Benedicts I've ever had!!\n\nI can't help but give high praise for their lunch which is only available Friday through Sunday. There are plenty of other things to try like their Comme Ca Burger, Fried Chicken Sandwich, and Red Velvet Bacon Waffles. Someday, I'll be back to try their dinner. I probably don't need to, because I would most likely end up going back for lunch anyways and I'm perfectly fine with that.",positive,en

"Footlight Parade is among the best of the 1930's musical comedy extravaganzas. A snappy script and an all-star cast including Jimmy Cagney, the lovely Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, and Ruby Keeler make this film a cut above the rest. Directed and choreographed by the creative genius Busby Berkeley, this film will have you grinning from ear-to-ear from start to finish.Busby, of course, is the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical with ""Gold Diggers of 1933"" and ""42nd Street"" to his credit (as Dance Director). Footlight Parade is graced by hundreds of scantily-clad chorus girls, a Berkeley trademark. The elaborate dance numbers were shot with only one camera and Busby was the first director to film close-ups of the dancers. His obsession with shapely legs and ""rear-view"" shots is amply demonstrated here. The overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing.Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent, a producer of ""prologues"" or short musical stage productions that were performed in movie theaters to entertain the audience before the talkies were shown. He's surrounded by crooked partners, a corporate spy, and a gold-digging girlfriend. Although Cagney had a solid background in vaudeville, this was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents. Joan Blondell is memorable as Cagney's wise-cracking, lovestruck secretary. And Ruby Keeler is adorable, as always.The film climaxes with three outstanding production numbers, ""Honeymoon Hotel"", ""The Waterfall"", and ""Shanghai Lil"", each one a masterpiece and not likely to be duplicated in today's Hollywood where so-called ""special effects"" have replaced creative cinematography.Claudia's Bottom Line: Clever and erotic, with some of the best musical production numbers ever put on celluloid. A thoroughly enjoyable Depression era romp.",positive,en
"My wife and I chose the James for a three day getaway in July. Though we arrived slightly early the young lady at the desk apologized for not having our room ready. She then said that she was going to upgrade us to a suite. We were thrilled with the prospect and agreed. Throughout our stay the service was consistently excellent. The room was spotless, and we enjoyed the turndown treats. We also took advantage of the complimentary car service. We were impressed with everything about the hotel and look forward to staying there again.",positive,en
"First trip to NY and beware the sirens! One side of the hotel is above a FIre Station and the fire tenders do go out a lot!!
We loved our studio and balcony. We were at the front of the hotel and found this quieter than the side suite we had the first night. The balcony seemed to block some of the traffic sounds from below.
Hotel is being updated and we heard the workmen in the morning above our room. Didn't bother us but may others.
Yes air conditioning units taped in window to reduce draughts were a 'feature' but we loved the hotel and friendly staff. The bed was really comfy and we appreciated the kitchenette and found a way round no kettle was to just put water in coffee filter to make tea in the morning!! It was all part of the NY experience.
Also a plus was the easy route in from JFK airport.via rail link. Then only a short walk to Affinia from station.
We walked everywhere and the Affinia always welcomed us 'home'. It may be a bit 'tired' in parts but we don't like perfection..we'd rather have frriendliness and quirky!!!",positive,en
"Stayed at Hotel Cornell for a long get-away weekend in San Francisco. This small hotel was constructed in 1910, the property has always been a hotel. Rooms are clean and tastefully/comfortably furnished, Common areas are likewise clean, attractive and functional. The included American breakfast (French toast or eggs and bacon) served in the basement dining room (again very clean and comfortable) makes a wonderful start to the day. Didnt try the restaurant for dinner, however did learn it is popular with locals for an authentic French meal. Most walls in the common areas are decorated with either murals or artwork. Found that to really add charm and uniqueness to the decor. Now understand that this hotel is not a Marriott, Hilton, Westin, etc etc. Some might find the traffic noise intrusive and the actual size of the room too cramped. If you are expecting a business-class hotel like the cookie-cutter chains then you might want to pass. If you are looking for a cozy, romantic, unique experience in San Francisco then you have to check this place out. With only 50 rooms the staff takes the time to get to know you and personalize your experience. That was truly wonderful! Parking is at a garage across the street - $20 a night (great deal for SF) with unlimited in/out and priority on account of being a hotel guest. The value received at Hotel Cornell is as good as I have experienced anywhere in the world.",positive,en

"Surprisingly good deal in Theatre District in New York. The room was quite spacious, especially for New York. Nice amenities in room including ironing board, bathroom amenities, lots of towels, great cable t.v., and free breakfast. I checked out too early for the free breakfast, so I can't comment on it. The room seemed generally clean, although the carpet was a dark color, which makes it hard to see just how clean it really is. There was one dried suspicious spot on the bed sheets. I saw no sign of bed bugs or insects. My room was on the ground lobby floor, with the door literally inside the lobby, so I did hear a little lobby noise, but not too bad. I would prefer to stay on a regular upper floor.
There are several Comfort Inn hotels in the area, with similar names, but this one on West 44th street seems to have the best location, between 8th and 9th avenue. Lots of people around day and night, so it seems like a very safe area to stay in. Just a few minutes walk to Times Square and Broadway theatres. Duane Read drugsstore nearby on 9th Avenue is very convenient and inexpensive compared to other places.

While being in KL I really wanted to try this experience. You have to book online but that was no problem. Straight forward. When I arrived they took note I was vegetarian which was good.

"When I was a student at Pitt I never went on the inclines. Even when I would come back to visit friends I never went and did this sort of \""touristy\"" thing. I finally got to go on the incline when I was in town for Superbowl weekend. I'm so glad I went!!\n\nThe price is \""wicked cheap\"" as we say in New England. I think it was less than $5 for the round-trip ticket plus the museum admission at the top of the slope. The view from the top is pretty nice, but seeing the old pictures of Pittsburgh and the inner workings of the incline pulley system were really what made it.",positive,en
"Every single person I told I was staying here said ""The rooms are so small!"". It's true but not such an issue to me, especially when I moved from the smoking room (bleeuurgh) and the only availability they had left on the first night, to a better corner room on a floor above. Clean and cool.
The real problems are the prices and the service.
Room was cheap at about $150 per night. But arrived very late and ordered room service, the cheapest bottle of wine was $55. Had an extremely average crab cake and a not bad macaroni cheese for a total of $100. Breakfast is $27 buffet for badly cooked eggs and croissants with lttle relation to their French relatives. Horribly weak coffee I replaced with two off menu stronger cappucinos which turned out to be $8 each, ba-da-bing and you have a $50 breakfast. I refrained from breakfasting there again.
But it was the service which was bad. Ages to check in on an understaffed reception. First morning I wanted to ask where the breakfast room was and two people behind the counter continued their conversation without acknowledging me, I waited until I finally had waited so long I tried to interrupt whereupon the lady held up a finger to me and said ""One minute ma'am"", very rudely. And one evening when I tried calling down to ask for a wake-up call the phone was literally never answered, three times.
It's also a little too much of a scene for me, and I like a scene. Went to the bar with a book on Sunday evening, opened it to a cacophany of music and DJ noise, closed it gently and quietly crept away. That said the roof terrace is lovely so I went there instead and consumed an $18 glass of chardonnay.
And I have to say, hotels still charging for wi-fi is blummin cheeky these days and as someone who travels a lot, it's one of my basic standards of a hotel and a good indicator of whether they want to be known for putting customers first. Not here.",positive,en

"Booked our four night stay at the Omni La Mansion in San Antonio through Priceline for a fantastic deal on the room; a double overlooking the pool on the second floor. Nice and quiet. The room itself was tastefully furnished, not particularly large, but very comfortable. Check-in staff were very cheerful and helpful as was the concierge when we inquired about amenities and sights in the city. The location of the hotel itself is the real appeal. It is situated near the bend in the river containing most of the popular restaurants and shopping, so the walk is easy and pleasant. The hotel itself is of the more ""romantic"" European-style architecturally as opposed to some of the modern glass and steel hotels near by. My understanding is that it has recently been revamped and the furnishings in the room seemed unworn and fairly fresh. I would, however, say that the service in the hotel restaurant ""La Canarias"" was excruciatingly slow. We ordered the ""express"" lunch off the menu and still waited almost 40 minutes for our food. I had to chase the waiter for refills on tea and to get the bread that the other tables had received. When checking out I asked for a total bill for my review. Experience had taught me to check charges before leaving the hotel and they appear on my credit card. The desk clerk told me that no charges were showing up on her computer (I had already paid for the room online) despite my use of the internet and room service, so I should ""just not worry about it"". Upon arriving home, I discovered a mystery charge of 332.74 on my credit card in addition to the expected internet charge of 9.95 per day. I called the hotel for an explanation of the 332.74 and was told the clerk had been ""confused"" and that a credit would be issued for that amount. I'm still waiting. Also, as a previous reviewer noted, the hotel charges 28 dollars per day just for parking. The city garage directly across the street charged us a rate of 6 dollars per day for a total of 24 dollars. It just doesn't make sense to park in the hotel garage at all. Over all, the hotel is lovely, the rooms are attractive (albeit not luxurious), the food is above average and the service is sporatic but friendly. We did not take advantage of the spa facilities. What visitors are really paying for is the outstanding location on the riverwalk.",positive,en
"I really like this hotel. When searching for a hotel in NY, I looked for one that was fairly central (Manhattan) and reasonably priced (i.e. as cheap as possible) and I found exactly that in Hotel Alexander. So as to keep the cost down, we opted to have a triple room with a shared bathroom in the corridor. I was nervous about it as I don't like sharing bathrooms with other rooms usually but I needn't have worried. There were three bathrooms for the floor and in 5 days I didn't have to wait once - at least one was always available.
The hotel is spotlessly clean, even the communal bathrooms. The room was very clean and the lovely cleaner always tidied it up and put things away for us, so we always had a nice clean room to come back to at the end of the day.
The location is really good as well. We were within walking distance to Central Park and it is a nice area, lots of wholesome looking people!
The price was right as well. We only paid ¬£506 for a four person room for 5 nights so for each person, it didn't cost much more than a youth hostel.
I would definately recommend this hotel and can't think of one bad thing to say about it.",positive,en

"We opted to stay at this hotel due to its proximity to the airport (we had a late flight) and its generally positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We booked our room well in advance and prepaid.
Our flight was delayed, and we didn't arrive until approximately 12:20 AM. I tried calling the hotel in order to inquire about the airport shuttle (which I later found out only runs until 11:00 PM, which is fine), but nobody answered the phone. We made numerous calls to both the local and toll free number, but nobody answered.
After getting a rental car and driving to this hotel, we found ourselves to be locked out of the loby (after hours entrance requires a room key, which is quite reasonable). However, nobody was at the front desk and a sign read ""Be right back.""
I proceeded to make multiple phone calls, and could hear the front desk phone ringing from my location in the foyer. After several minutes, the desk attendant drove up and parked his car facing the wrong direction in the guest unloading zone.
When I politely expressed my frustration and concerns with ""Joe"" (the attendant), his suspiciously slurred response was ""I'm not going to lie to you -- we're all sold out and there must have been 100 people call about rooms, so I just stopped answering the phone.""
No apology or explanation of why he was off the premises when pre-paid customers cannot check in to their rooms (let alone even get admission into the building).
This is unacceptable and highly inappropriate. Moreover, the hotel staff should not be leaving it unattended overnight. This could potentially result in a very dangerous situation, and it will be the last time I consider staying at this particular hotel.
I will certainly bring this up with management in the morning.",positive,en

"Our family (children age 9 and 12) recently stayed at this hotel for two nights while visiting NYC. The hotel exceeded our expectations in every way! The location is fantastic - we were able to walk to the theater, to Time Square, to the shops on 5th Ave and even to NBC studios for their morning show. The parking garage was located next door (easy access if you forgot something in your car) and there was a 24 hr Rite Aid on the next block.
The rooms were larger than rooms of other hotels in which we've stayed in the past (this is our family's 4th or 5th trip to NYC), and the beds were very comfortable. The Hampton Inn offers a full free breakfast every morning with a wide variety of choices, and there are complimentary apples and coffee all day in the lobby. The concierge was extremely knowledeable and helpful (saved us an unnecessary extra subway ride to Yankee stadium!), and the rest of the staff was the same.

The staff was friendly, bed was comfy, and the room was cleaned perfectly. Good TV, comfy ergonomic desk chair and lots of bathroom supplies. Free wifi in the lobby which was good enough for me. No complaints about noise etc. like another traveller mentioned. Everything I expect from Hilton and that's why I like staying with that brand. The place took a little bit of time to get used to though because there are 3 towers and many entrances etc. Various rental car agencies right across the street. It was also perfectly located near Union Square and various public transit options. I would suggest however not buying from Starbucks in the lobby - they charge a full dollar more for a coffee than the Starbucks 1 block away (towards Union Square).",positive,en

"My husband and I ate dinner here on my birthday, and we were both extremely please. The restaurant was practically empty on a Monday night, but the waitstaff was extremely attentive. Our waiter brought us samples of wine based on what we liked (we ended up going with beer and mixed-drinks, though the wine was very good). The bread was warm and delicious (we were told it's made there daily) with good butter and mustard. We tried the soup du jour, which was a yellow pepper soup, a vegetarian soup which is usually hard to find, and it was good (I added some salt and pepper to give it more of a kick). My husband had the homestyle chicken dish, and I opted for the lobster crepe. Both were excellent (my husband practically licked his plate clean). The waiters and host came by numerous times to check on us and ask how everything was. It was a great experience!",positive,en
"older hotel but rooms were clean and had great view. you would get a great view from most rooms unless you were in the bottom floor. we had the harbour view and our teemage children had the marina view. both were good but we preferred the harbour view room. there are 2 separate towers which are 5 min walk apart. we stayed in the smaller tower. the pool and gym is smaller but we could use the one in the other tower if we wanted to. The parking can be a problem so i would go with valet parking if possible.

"This Espresso is definitely the best Espresso Royale at U of I. The baristas are AWESOME and have GREAT senses of humor. The new manager has really stepped it up in terms of making it a really interesting and charasmatic place to be ( if a store could be charasmatic). If you're used to starbucks and their sweet sweet coffee, it'll take some time to get used to the drinks but in the long run its what coffee should taste like. The enviornment is worth it in itself and the pastries are baked and sandwiches are made fresh everyday. Plus their soups kick @ss. love it.",positive,en
"Spent second week of June at the Fairmont. It is a special hotel, we had a room in the tower which is not a suite but has plenty of room and a massive panoramic window. Reception said it had a bay view but that is really on the North Side of the tower, even so it was a great view. Caffe Cento is the place to go for breakfast as the buffet breakfast in the restaurant is superb but very expensive.All the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location on the cross roads of the California, Powell and Hyde cable car lines. We got a Citypass for $49 each which gets you free on all Muni transport for a week. Much better value than the city sightseeing bus provided you get hold of a good route map. Best way out of the hotel to the Powell Line is through Cafe Cento or the garage. Virgin Limo to the airport costs ¬£48.
Best things we did included riding on the cablecars and tramcars, wine country tour with Grayline ($69 each), Science Museum in Golden Gate Park, Coit Hill (get a 39 bus from Washington Square or Fishermans Wharf and bay cruise. Didn't bother with Alcatraz. Good places we ate were Macy's Cheesecake Factory. Johnny Foleys Bar on O'Farrell Street, Cove Cafe on Castro, Tonga (at the Fairmont), Buena Vista Bar on Hyde Street opposite the cable car terminal and McCormick & Kuleto's seafood restaurant nearby. If you want free wireless then join the Fairmont Presidents Club before you arrive.",positive,en

"Warning: Does contain spoilers.Open Your EyesIf you have not seen this film and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it. You have to see this film. I have seen it four times so far and I still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film. That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now.If you are still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think.I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well. His name was Mr. Krisak. To me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on. If we didn't like Shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it. Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time. This was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds. I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix. Now if I didn't know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we'll assume it wasn't him. But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real. Show me how you can tell that you are real. This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine. Everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real. After every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless.""What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?""What if you were someone else's dream? What a messed up question that is. This was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computers. How possible could it seem back then? But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone else's dream.Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to. In short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you.Open your Eyes.Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of governers, the Seven Dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. Early in the film we meet one of David's gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. This is the type of relationship commensurate with David's other flings he's had in the sexual prime of his life. And although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. Next we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith's good buddy Jason Lee. Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends. This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film. Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again. And that is "" the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter."" He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two.At David's huge birthday bash, (so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress. This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another. And in typical David fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with Sofia. To complicate things, Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another. There is no hanky panky. The next day, as David is leaving Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride and from there.......well, I think we have all seen the commercials.That is all I will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception. We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze. There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us, but it doesn't end there.Like many movies seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret. Sixth Sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze. Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters. And what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through. I have seen this film four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up, something more I can understand. To be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film. All of the ersatz so called ""Best Pictures of the year"" have been good but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it. I know this film has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it. This is what film making is supposed to be like. This is what a film is supposed to do to you. It is supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces. This one isn't.10 out of 10 The best film of the year. I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress, Diaz for best supporting, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe should there as well. None of this may come to pass, and that is a shame. This is one film that should not be missed. And on a final note, I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question. Can you prove you are real? Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement? This is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers. And I'm sure that is just fine with him.Open Your Eyes",positive,en
"I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life. Don't tell me they can't act, because they most definitely can.They can also write. Sure, Jack & Bob get the sole credits, but in reality, they got a big helping hand on that script from the Monkees, who were also in that smoke-filled room.(it is absolutely impossible to spoil this film) Head is very highly symbolic. Among the more memorable elements is the black box, which was actually based on 2 things: the Monkee image that the boys were bound to, and the real black box on the Screen Gems lot where the band was kept between takes. There's so much more symbolism in the movie that I'll just let you watch it and figure it out.The music is awesome. ""Circle Sky"" is one of Papa Nez's best tunes ever, and ""Porpoise Song"" & ""As We Go Along"" will have you enthralled. If you'd rather be weirded out, then ""Ditty Diego"", ""Can You Dig It?"", and ""Long Title"" should be satisfactory, great songs that they are. And then there's ""Daddy's Song"", without a doubt a homage to Davy's Broadway days, and the editing/color scheming for that sequence is superb. (At least for '68.)Oh, For those of you who won't watch a 'PG' film, you're missing out. Especially since Head was originally rated R in 1968. The rating was lowered about TWENTY years later!Now where was I? Ah, yes: ""We were speaking of beliefs. Beliefs and conditioning....""",positive,en

"One of two of my favorite sushi places located in the middle of the desert! Located on the west side, Lahaina Grill caters to the locals of Summerlin and the surrounding area. The 24 hour sushi is no longer available but they do still serve it up until 4am.\n\nLots of special rolls to choose from on their menu...one of my favorites, the Lahaina Special (of course.) They also have a happy hour sushi menu that is quite an excellent value. \n\nThe interior is unique (in a good way) with a tropical setting and the restaurant is clean. There is a full bar with video poker machines built in, a sushi bar (no machines) and plenty of table seating throughout. There's also a private room that can be reserved for meetings and parties that is sealed off with big windows and doors so you can be as loud and rowdy as you want without disturbing other patrons. I miss my old company's monthly meetings in there. I really enjoyed being able to order sushi at 9am on a weekday during a business meeting or rolling in at 3am after a night of partying craving sushi.

"I have never written a review but felt I just had to after staying at this hotel. This was our first trip to New York City and we worked very hard to research the best price, location and amenities. This was a family reunion so we reserved 3 rooms total and each one was a little different from the other. We were traveling from December 26th through December 29th 2006.
This Comfort Inn was adorable because it was a ""boutique style"" so you didn't feel like you where in a typical cookie cutter chain hotel. It was located on 35th street between 5th and 6th so it was walking distance to the Empire State Building, around the corner from Macy's and many other shops and even had an attached resturant ( with the best pizza I've had in a long time I might add) where you recieved a 15% discount as a guest at the hotel. This was also where the contenential breakfast was served each morning. With four teenages in our group it was enough to fill them up so all we had to buy was a hot dog on the street for lunch and then a nice dinner.
A half a block away was a Starbucks, 24 hour drug store , subway station and deli. Across the street were two irish pubs (not loud) and parking.
Upon arrival our rooms were ready early and we checked right in. There was also a very friendly and helpful bellman at the curb to help us unload. He was also there the day we left to help us load our car.
The rooms were not huge but were very clean with new up to date bedding, new carpet and very comfortable beds. The bathroom was also very clean and adequit for our needs.
It's easy to see you are in an old building when you are there with the old marble and wood staircase and very small eleveators but that really added to the charm of being in NYC!

"I have been staying at this hotel annually for the Texas vs. OU game. For the last several years both the condition of the property and the service have been getting increasingly worse. We were going to change hotels but the hotel boasted about the new ownership and all the money spent to renovate every single guest roome - i'm sorry the place again is worse - and the renovations clearly missed all of the 2nd floor. Carpets are filthy, sinks wont drain. The beds are really comfortable so that is a plus. The front desk staff is usually rude. As an example, i booked 3 rooms in my name for our group. Each person was with me at check in and wanted to transfer the rooms to their credit card. The front desk staff made this almost impossible. I finally had to threaten that i would deny the charges - then a manager appeared and they fixed it. The sign at the front says ""new management that wants to ensure a 10 rated experience.""

"We bought their Groupon Deal which consist of soup, salad, main course and desert.The soup came in potato and leek soup (pretty tasty) and roast duck with vege (alright).The salad was classical prawn cocktail (alright) and tuna carpaccio (this was surprisingly really good!).The mains were filo wrapped salmon fillet (my father-in-law didn't like it), porky cordon bleu (this was pretty good), and fiery ribs (alright). We wanted the prawn and pork sizzling but was disappointed they did not have that even though we were one of the first diners there that night.The desert was vanilla or chocolate ice cream which was nothing to shout about.So overall, more hits than misses. It was a bit pricey tho and if not for the Groupon deal, we may not have gone there to eat with all the cheaper hawker stalls in Ipoh.",positive,en
"In May 2014, I went on a search to find a workout partner...simply to help keep me motivated. What I found was Seth at TPT, and group training. For the longest time, my body and weight were stagnant. Even though I was trying everything...I wasn't seeing any positive changes and I was losing motivation. I went for my physical assessment on May 12th and it's been an amazing transition so far! I literally saw results in the first two weeks of training...and my physical energy is through the roof!! It doesn't matter what age or level of fitness you're at, Seth and the trainers at TPT are extremely knowledgeable about customizing the training and diet specifically for what YOU need...without breaking the bank either! I've gained so many great things since joining the TPT family...great training, great results, great friends and on my way to a great body!!!",positive,en

"I LOVE this place. Are the hours too short? Yes. Would I prefer a larger, more central location? Of course. But, unless the prices are jacked to the sky, I will keep going there for the food and the philosophy. \n\nThe croissants are, bar-none, the best in the valley. No joke. They are buttery, flakey, flavorful (my mouth is watering as I write this) and worth twice what I pay for them. The chocolate croissants are heaven on a plate. I will say that I was slightly disappointed in the almond croissant, not because it wasn't good, but because it was too sweet compared to the plan or chocolate ones. \n\nI love my mochas, as well, and they have a great one here. I highly recommend it with one caveat: the mocha is perfectly sweetened UNLESS you eat a sweet item before it. Therefore, when buying both a chocolate croissant and a mocha (which I often do,) either drink the mocha first, or eat the croissant and wait before tasting the mocha. Trust me, they are both delicious if eaten correctly :)\n\nThe macaroons are amazing! I prefer the creamy ones (hazelnut, vanilla, caramel, dulce de leche, pumpkin) but some people prefer the fruity ones with jam in them. The chocolate has a fudgy, not creamy filling. It's still good, but it's not what I was expecting.\n\nAs I said, their philosophy is awesome. They buy local and organic, compost, use sustainable resources and recycle. What can I say? It's everything I want in a restaurant!\n\nTry to avoid this place at lunch because it is CRAZY busy. But tasty, tasty, tasty.",positive,en

"My husband and I traveled to Chicago for a family wedding. We reserved our room through a group rate for the wedding. We asked for a King bed, but was told it might not be possible. When we checked in we asked again for a King and was told one was available. The room was nice, but the bathroom is very small. My husband and I could not be in the bathroom at the same time. As always with a Holiday Inn hotel, the staff was very nice and helpful. They hotel had two restaurants attached to it. The food was okay, nothing to rave about. There is no parking at the hotel, except valet. The price varies on who you talk with. Online it states valet parking is $44 a night, a hotel staff stated it was $35 a night, and we ended up being charged $30 a night. So ask about the price of valet parking. The hotel is close to Union Station and a CTA blue line stop. Overall, we had a good stay with a wonderful staff.",positive,en

"I can't even tell you how wonderful the peruvian cuisine is here. Actually, I can. I went to this place because I live very close by. I didn't expect much when walking in. Decor is cool, but it was not busy at all which worried me. We asked the waiter what his fave dish was and he said the Lomo Saltado. I ordered it and fell in love the minute the food touched my lips. It's quality beef strips, sauteed with white onions and sliced tomoatoes. It is cooked in a vinegar/beer marinade and tossed with french fries. My husband got the Milanesa. It is breaded steak with a side of a beautiful pesto pasta. We haven't tried any seafood here but that happens to be one of their specialties.

"I stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked. The story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves, waves that are monstrously huge, waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves. There is nothing special about the film, other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk. Sure there are scenes of them surfing, but what makes this movie so special is the people. Here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching. Half way into this movie you'll want to go off and learn to surf as well. Few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film. See it.",positive,en

"We are in Memphis for a birthday getaway... tickets to a Grizzlies game, yummy food, etc... I have stayed at the Peabody several times but never at the Madison, although I had looked into it more than once.
I ""price-lined"" our room and paid $335 for two nights, taxes and fees included. I had read a couple reviews on Trip Advisor that people felt they were given a ""poor location"" because of using PriceLine to acquire their room... We did, in fact, receive a room located where others were... right beside the elevator... perhaps this is the practice, maybe these are the smallest rooms (?) but I have a very strong feeling that if, in fact, I was disappointed in the room and had expressed this to the front desk, we would have been relocated.
The front desk staff were absolutely wonderful. Upon arrival, a very nice woman greeted us, checked us in, and made sure we had trolley maps and info on the area. There were drinks and chocolate-covered strawberries for guests.
Our room was very small...but the website lists square footage of each room, so it is not something they try to conceal... Despite the size, the room was very clean and the bathroom was well-appointed...with the most wonderful shower head in the shower/tub and several ""extras"" along with the standard soaps, shampoo, etc... (shower cap, cotton swabs, cotton facial pads)
I did miss having a refrigerator in the room---rarely use the microwave so frequently included---but did miss the fridge... They are available in the bigger rooms, however.
The beds were firm (I'm a soft bed fan but the yummy sheets made up for the firm mattress) and I have become quite attached to a fabulous blanket that was an ""extra"" located on a shelf under the television.
Hopefully tomorrow we will visit the top of the building to enjoy the view...so far, weather has not allowed it...
We ordered room service and everything was delicious... Cynthia from the front desk made a special request for me to have the crispy creme brulee delivered to our room even though it was not ""in room dining"" but restaurant only and it was the best ever... We had cocktails our first night in the hotel and room service the second. Be sure and eat at Eighty3 if possible and have either the blueberry bread pudding or the crispy creme brulee... wonderful...
We enjoyed the complimentary turn-down service at night and the chocolates on our pillows... also enjoyed ice in the ice bucket when we returned to our room... (reminded me of being on a cruise!)
I wish we did not have to leave tomorrow... and I wish the weather had been warmer... but, that's just more motivation to return, I suppose!
I do think I would like to experience a bigger room in the hotel, although I'm not sure it's feasible for stays that have you out of the room more than in it...
Between the Madison and the Peabody, aside from the size of our room, the Madison tops in all categories... I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone.. and you can always walk over to the Peabody and enjoy the lobby and see the ducks... but then you can return to the Madison and to friendly people like Cynthia, have a complimentary chocolate strawberry & a mimosa and cuddle up in your room...",positive,en

Great hotel, great location and views, really nice room (just don't get one overlooking I-95 unless you have earplugs). So the room rate was great (about $120) but parking is $30 and meals are expensive. For breakfast use the little snack place for a bagel and cream cheese, otherwise breakfast will be over $20.

"As a big Dostoyevsky fan, I had always been disappointed with Hollywood's halfhearted attempts to get into the Russian romantic aesthetic -- case in point, Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When given an intelligent script to work with, he suddenly came alive and was as noble, sexy, and conflicted as you could ever want a Neurotic Russian Officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri. But that's because writer Tabori actually gave Yul, as the Conflicted Russian Officer, the kind of Conflicted Russian Officer lines that are worthy of real literature, and that have real meaning and pathos in them. For example, a propos of folk music, he says musingly, ""You hear a man crying in the dark. And if you listen carefully enough, you know what he cries for. You look surprised, Lady Ashmore. Despite what you may have heard, tractors and Marxism aren't the only things the Russian cares for. There is always time for music.""Brilliant!!",positive,en

"Don't pay any attention to the previous negative comments. They are unfounded or perhaps it was a different Hotel Adagio. My wife and I stayed here in February of 2004 for my 40th birthday and enjoyed every minute of our stay at the Hotel Adagio. To put this into proper perspective I travel frequently for work and stay at some of the best hotels in the country such as the Soho Grand and Le Parker Meridian in NYC as well as the Mondrian and Shutters in L.A. We chose the Adagio after considering several others such as the Clift (which is across the the street), the Rex and the Monaco. We could not have been happier with our choice. The Hotel Adagio ranks up there with all of them in terms of accomodations and helpfulness of staff. Upon arrival we were asked if we would like to upgrade to a suite for a mere $25 extra per night. What a bargain. The hotel compares to any of the Phillip Stark designed hotels, however, without all the attitude. After a long day of sightseeing and shopping we looked forward to returning to the Adagio for a couple glasses of wine at the stylish (albeit beautiful people scene) bar and then relaxing in our room. If I were returning to San Francisco tomorrow I would stay at the Hotel Adagio in a heartbeat. Do yourself a favor and stay at this wonderful hotel.",positive,en

"Let's get this party started. \n\nIt's been my good fortune to have a few opportunities to drop in on Madison this past year, marvelling at the miracle of the farmer's market with its 20,000 people genially all walking in the same direction and had great dinners and drinks at Nostrano, Merchant and Graze and great meats and cheeses from Fromagination. \n\nA friend more familiar with the scene than me learned I was heading through again and alerted me that The Underground Food Collective had just opened a butcher shop and it sounded fabulous. \n\nIt's fabulous. I stopped in last night and assembled a hotel room charcuterie plate for the ages - soft and bursting-with-fresh-fennel-flavor Finocchiona (sorry for the alliteration), Culatello (!) - lush and sweet with a just-right note of Funk, a 16 month Gouda and a country baguette as good as any I've ever had. The meat case was laden with sausage, poultry and beautiful cuts that made me wish my hotel would let me into the kitchen. \n\nWanted to make it back on my way back to Chicago today for a housemade Hot Dog with Kimchi and to load up on fresh sausage but couldn't quite swing it. \n\nThe owners are recent Chicago transplants who were probably eager to ply their trade in a supportive state and a city free of both Aldermen and abundant extra regulations. Their pickled product - displayed but not able to be sold - looked equally fantastic and the space is raw, gorgeous and not overly-styled. \n\nThey are Good Kids. If you're fortunate enough to live in Madison go support them. I'll be back, with a cooler. \n\nAlso check out the Collective's social media and videos. Funny, sincere, useful - Good stuff.

"This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is hilarious. The best thing is the laughter never stops. The plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure. But this movie is about Amitabh and thats all you remember at then end.Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious. Later in the movie he turns into the Angry Young Man he is famous for but the humour stays. Memorable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.All in all I was rolling with laughter throughout the movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at his absolute best - this is it. It will easily give it a 10/10.",positive,en
"Good Location and Nice Rooms
I stayed here for a few nights on a business trip in September 2012. The hotel is in a great location, next to China Town and Little Italy. The rooms are spacious, modern, and clean. Perfectly setup for business and pleasure.
There can be some noise coming in from the street if you're staying on the lower floors so they hook you up with ear plugs. I stayed on the 9th floor and did not need to use them.
Unfortunately I did not have time to check out the hotel amenities such as the lobby bar (I think they have two) or the fitness facility.
The only issue I had with the hotel was the front desk staff. They were very nice but not knowledgeable. They did allow me to check in super early at 10am but here is the downside. My company called in several times to pay for the room but yet they could not figure it out. It took a fourth try to get it right. It was a bit annoying. Also, they had no clue about the internet available in the rooms. At least the person I talked to did not. They have both wi-fi and ethernet (hardwire) for those with the same question I did.
I would give them a 4 star but making a 3 because of the paying issue.",positive,en

"I'm a fan of well-done, simple, no-frills burgers, and Smashburger is just that. A co-worker and I just came back from a wonderful lunch and I'm completely satisfied. I opted to build my own burger and went with a 1/2lb. burger on the chipotle bun with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, mustard, and chipotle sauce. I'm not a fan of a lot of spices on my fries so I went with the regular. A cold cherry coke made my meal complete. I was told it would be 5-7 minutes before my order was ready, and not more than five minutes later, it was brought out to our table. Not only was the presentation really nice, but the burger was out of this world! It was cooked just as I like it (well-done) and was really hot and juicy. The fries were good on their own, but paired with the chipotle sauce, they were near perfect. The awesome food coupled with the friendly, efficient service ranks Smashburger up in my top three favorite burgers in town. Well done!",positive,en
"While my kids enjoyed the movie (and announced afterward that they want to buy it later) I think I got more out of it that they did. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cutting comment aloud, but I thought it). It is a feel good mid-life movie, a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his Mom is dying?), but all in all and good time. It also gave our family something to talk about - did my kids think my life was boring? What do they expect at 40?

"I was in Phoenix for business and decided to stay at this property. This hotel is very convenient for all types of travellers. The bathrooms are a bit dated, but the rest of the room is well appointed with the usual modern fare: flat screen TV, WiFi, alarm, desk, table, etc. What always gets me in most hotels is a lack of electrical outlets by the bed. I called reception and a surge protector was brought up for me right away. Wonderful service.
Another characteristic that I liked was the option not to have your room made up everyday. If you do not wish for formal housekeeping, then you have an option of getting 500 Starwood points or $5 dollars in food credit for the hotel. As I am not a slob, and not such a stickler if my room is not made up, I opted for the Starwood points.
The staff is friendly and welcoming. I would be happy to stay at this property again.",positive,en

"I stayed at the intercontinental SFO on a business trip in January- hotel is conveniently located downtown within reasonable walking distance to the waterfront, Chinatown, and just a block from the Moscone West convention center. I had a room on the 28th floor with a FANTASTIC view of the city. Rooms are clean and nicely appointed- bed was very comfortable. Staff was very friendly and allowed me to check in early. There is a gym on the 6th floor that is open 24h which is very convenient, and provides water and fruit as well. The lobby bar is a nice meeting spot (try the Italian mojito) but if you really want to be blown away, head to the View bar on the 39th floor of the Marriott (a couple blocks away)!",positive,en

You have a macdonalds across from you and also a starbucks and a TGI fridays. Request a high floor as you will get a excellent view we was on the 37th floor and it was great.

"We came for dinner just before 6 on a Thursday. I had noticed they had happy hour until 6, but the hostess informed us this was only at the bar. We could have saved a few $$ if we had just done that, but honestly the food was so good I didn't feel bad paying more. \n\nBread was brought to our table and served with a pesto dipping sauce - I ate the remainder of the sauce with my hands it was so good.\n\nWe ordered the Mediterranean salad and piccante flatbread. I also ordered a red sangria - which was different from normal sangria since it had crushed berries it it - but it was one of the best sangrias I've ever had. The salad and flatbread were delicious. The salad was big and worth the price - flatbread was good but maybe a better deal on the happy hour menu since it was smaller than expected. \n\nThe food was the perfect portion so we still had room for dessert. We decided on the coconut cakes with blood orange sorbet. This is probably gross but I honestly did not want to swallow my cake - I kept it in my mouth like a fine red wine and savored every last piece. \n\nThis restaurant needs to come to Chicago - I would be all over it like white on rice.",positive,en

"Just returned from a weekend at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown. The hotel is very impressive. When we drove up, there were multiple car attendants to greet us, quickly remove our bags and get us to the front desk for check in. The check in was quite seamless and the staff were very kind, considerate, warm and caring. By the time I receive my keys, I was already quite excited about being at this amazing hotel. The lobby is exciting and convenient having concierge services, a Fedex, a Starbucks and a restaurant and shopping all within the hotel. The hotel has recently had a renovation and our room felt quite new with nice bathroom amenities, very comfortable bedding and state of the art televisions. When we called ""At Your Service"" to request a hypoallergenic pillow for my wife, it was brought instantly and with a smile. What is further amazing about this hotel is its unbelievable location. I was able to walk easily to Rittenhouse Square, to the theatre to see ""the Buddy Holly Story"", to all of the shopping, restaurants and sightseeing that I wanted to do. The hotel is right next to the Reading Market, the Convention Center and is very near the beautiful shopping areas. This is a hotel that I felt when I left that I was truly feeling at home. Cannot wait to return!!!",positive,en

"This hotel is absolutely the best value for the price that I have ever found. The location is absolutely perfect (especially if you find the little walkway that connects the street it is on with the Hollywood/Highland complex...a little hidden, but once found, makes an extremely short walk even shorter). The staff is excellent and always ready to help (and call someone to find an answer if they don't know it personally). The breakfast, while small as some other reviews have stated, is delicious and enough to keep you going (with all the great restaurants in LA, why would you want to stuff yourself on a huge continental breakfast anyways?) Parking can be a bit of a struggle, but at least it is free instead of $20/night like at other nearby hotels (Tip: if coming in in the middle of the day when the lot is a little less crowded, turn around and back in, makes getting out next time MUCH easier). The decor in the rooms is very cute. I can't find a single thing to complain about. Wonderful,
would recommend to almost anyone (though I'm not sure about handicap access, didn't see any ramps or level entrances anywhere). Definitely will stay here again the next time I'm lucky enough to return to LA.",positive,en

"I booked this hotel for a total of eight days in mid-to-late June when I needed to come to Chicago for an operation. The room they gave me (twice - on either side of the surgery) was large and clean; it had both a refrigerator and a microwave. The bathroom alone was larger than some hotel rooms I have stayed in. Everything worked properly and the bed was comfortable (important for a recuperating surgical patient). The staff were friendly and informative. There is wireless internet capability in the rooms and a dedicated terminal in the lobby for those who need web access but don't have a laptop. There were perhaps five restaurants and three stores very nearby (one to two blocks), and Chicago's metro rail system was accessible a block away. I don't know how anyone could rate this a bad hotel; my stay was wonderful, and I'll definitely book again if ever need to go back to Chicago. By the way, the Hilton is about two blocks away - in the ""bad direction"" - and their prices were $ignificantly higher... I highly recommend the Travelodge.",positive,en

"Stayed here for two nights with my wife and granddaughter. We were given a room with a view of the bay and a peak of Alcatraz. We arrived and were greeted politely by the doorman. The lobby was large, clean and the front desk staff was excellent.
We were assigned a room with a king and used a rollaway for the GD. They offered us two full's but I said I would kill my wife if we had to sleep on such a small bed.
Three elevators and they all worked. Clean halls, newer hallway carpets and well lit.
Our room was clean overlooked California Street with its cable car line. Yes it is a little noisy but you are in the city. If you want a quieter room get one of the interior rooms they will be very quite but you will not have a view unless the guest across the way is cute.
Rooms in SF are small. We were OK with the rollaway but it was a little snug. The tub and toilet are in a separate area off the main bathroom but I didn't like the louvered door separating the sink and closet area with the main room. It should be a solid door.
The shower had great pressure but if you are any taller than 5-8 (me) it is very low. It looked like they ran out of pipe or made a big mistake on measuring. But it worked well and I got along.
The rooms were clean, well lit, updated and quite expect for the exterior noise.
We used the club lounge several times. They served breakfast with eggs, oatmeal, various fruits and pastries. Good coffee and OJ. They have yogurt and milk, sodas, water available all day. At night they had a cold plate, desserts etc. We get free access so this feature saved us a few $ at breakfast.
PARKING IS OUTRAGOUSE IN SF. 52.00 per night 6 of that is taxes. It is expensive all over town and you will be very lucky to find a street park. I saw parking rates from 6.00 to 9.00 per hour. So be prepared. There were cheaper places to park about two blocks away but that lacks convenience and on rainy days not very fun.

"Very cool hotel. Very nice lobby, stylish and hip. One thing to remember is that most of the hotels that are located in the Union Square area are very old which means very small rooms and small bathrooms. So if you want a big room and big bathroom good luck at that in this area. So with that said, the room was decorated very nice and modern along with the bathroom but they are quiet small. Another thing too is that no matter what time of day or night this area is noisy and you can hear it from your rooms no matter what floor your on. The Redwood Bar downstairs was very nice to have a drink, Friday and Saturday is was full with lots of hipsters. I did not get to eat at their restaurant. We got lucky and paid only $120 a night for the rooms on a Cheap O Air website. I would say that if I had to pay the normal rate for this room I would be a little pissed since like I said the rooms are quiet small.",positive,en

The difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the most profound human decay.""Pixote"" is one of the films that dare to touch and open these so painful wounds, and does it without the slightest glimmer of hope, in an honest portrayal of a country that, like Pixote himself, is already lost.",positive,en

Wayne Crawford went on to become a successful producer, films like Valley Girl, Night of the Comet and others, even though he wasn't too terrific in this little Gem. And little known Abe Zwick should have gotten tons of work from this film but didn't. Filmed at Moberly Studios in Hollywood Florida, on the same lot the early Tarzan movies were filmed. This film is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. The movie was originally shot with some nudity and much more graphic slasher scenes. For reasons only known to Tom Casey the Director, the bloody slasher scenes were given a tab of LSD, and the nudity was removed. Even though this version is worthy of a look for those so inclined, in my opinion, the original version would have packed the punch needed to make this a full on Slasher 70's Cult Classic.",positive,en

"I was delighted with my sleek but comfy hotel room. Clean lines. Good bed. Modern upgraded bathroom with nice faucets. The fruit bowl on the gorgeous Saarinen end table made my day.
But then bedtime came, and I noticed two very important things that hadn't mattered until then. The room has shudders not curtains, which means a ton of light comes through. No problem: I have an eye shade in my travel bag. But the second problem's major: There is non-stop truck and other traffic on the street below the window, and the windows offer absolutely no sound blocking at all. I live in NYC so am used to street noise, but I woke up continuously through the night and am dragging today because of it.
The hotel management should know that there are sound blocking windows that should be installed above busy streets. I was on a high floor, so I can't even imagine how bad the noise would be on the low floors. If the hotel has interior rooms, you should ask for one.",positive,en

I thought I did and after calling them direct and then receiving an email confirmation with the final rate they told me something different when it came to check out and paying. I sent them my email with my he confirmed rates later on but they did not honour it so as it was only 50 $ and it was a great hotel I left it alone. 2. You have to pay $10/day for wireless.. in this day and age and for this type of hotel it seems odd to me.",positive,en

"There are absolutely NO words to describe how BEAUTIFUL this hotel is! From when you walk into the lobby you are greeted with professionalism & class! We were offered free hot chocolate and free wi-fi while we waited for our check-in in the sleek lobby. We went on a short sightsee of the hotel and sipped on cocktails at the surprisingly HUGE full bar! There is also a full restaurant to suffice an appitite you may have. When we arrived to the 20th floor of our room the view itself was remarkable!! I recommend getting the city view which is a room in the corner of the hotel where you can view the breathtaking sights of the city with the Bay Bridge as the backdrop! From the flat screen television to the most comfortable bed I've EVER slept on, it's the hotel you HAVE to be in when you come to San Francisco! - Sia D.",positive,en

"We recently stayed at the hotel after booking the night on a third party website. The central location makes up for much grief but be warned about the mixed bag of rooms they have. We arrived at 6 PM to a very busy hotel (lobby was full of Irish people, probably on their Christmas shopping trip to NYC) and my wife checked us in. Unfortunately we must have gotten one of the last open room which was a.) by itself in a separate walkway next to the elevator shaft, b.) next to the vending machine and ice maker, and c.) very small with an equally small window to the outside. Looking out of the window on the 28th floor one could see....another set of room windows in the next facade of the hotel about 20 feet away (close curtain for privacy!).
Should have changed rooms right there and then but did not, so we had to endure the procession of people to the ice maker for the next 5 or so hours - and those room doors are paper-thin. The room itself was, as others described, pretty bar bones with no mini-bar and generally only ""Holiday-Inn"" like decor and furniture/accessories. Strange enough the TV signal was very weak so the picture of the TV was grainy and somewhat blurry.
I have had some bad hotel rooms in New York and this one was not the worst, but given the grand name of the hotel and the standard room rate this was underwhelming. Next time I would ask to be moved to another room. Glad I did not pay full price for the hotel.",positive,en

"I hope I will be just as satisfied as I was this time. It was my first time at the Hotel Newton and I selected the location to be near my granddaughter's school which was just a couple of blocks away. My daughter and granddaughter stayed with me so I was a solo traveler but a hotel guest with a family.
The hotel exceeded my expectations in almost every respect. The staff was super professional and attentive. The room was very clean and comfortable, for the most part. My only complaints are 1) the radiator heat can not be controlled by guests and 2) the television had white vertical lines always present. With respect to the room temperature, we were so thankful we could open the window but that, of course, allowed more street noise in. My daughter retrieved a fan from home and we were able to use that for circulation and ""white noise"" for the rest of our stay (5 nights total) but most people will not have that option. As far as the television goes, it was certainly tolerable and most folks will not be holed up in their room watching it. We were told that all television sets in the hotel had the lines (see photo).
Yes, the elevator is slow but I've experienced worse in Europe. Since we were on the second floor we usually took the stairs. We paid $5 a day for internet - - free would have been nice but no big deal. I booked my room through booking.com and missed a great deal offered by the hotel. I probably should have realized that after the holidays something like that might have been available.
The neighborhood had everything we needed and I felt totally safe moving around on my own. Unfortunately, my granddaughter became ill while we were there but even that was manageable with an urgent care location a couple of blocks away and a drug store next door. Central Park is located just a few blocks to the east and a major subway station just steps away.
I would absolutely stay at the Hotel Newton again.",positive,en

It's absolutely delightful! There are new designs and murals on the wall, and neat dividers between booths. The bar looks wonderful and the table tops are shiny and new. There are all new wooden floors too. This place got an overhaul and looks great!\n\nOur server was a new girl who had been there a few months, and she did a pretty good job. I had the spinach artichoke chicken flatbread pizza as an \""aussie-tizer\"" and it was AMAZING! It's only available for a limited time and I highly recommend you get to try it while they have it! There is an awesome happy hour that spans as long as their open, \""billabong hours\"" they call it. In Australia a billabong is a watering hole, and so at the Outback the bar is their billabong. Their small draft domestic beers are only $1.95 and the house wine is only $2.50 a glass. I know right? Awesome!\n\nThe food was outstanding as ever, 10 oz Strips are delicious and the perfect size. And to top it off with a chocolate thunder from down under was the icing on the cake! This place is just legit from top to bottom.\n\nOn a side note, the manager there, Scott Hughes, is an amazing guy. I've met him a few times and he's always so incredibly cordial. He is the essence of hospitality and customer service. He is always walking around talking with guests ensuring everyone is doing great in his establishment. He really takes pride in his work, which is so rare to see nowadays in the restaurant industry. This guy is great at what he does and I'm glad I know him.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood by Superstition Mall I highly recommend going to this place.

"It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring. The absurdity of the goings-on, the thick Australian accents and the bizarre set of characters all help to ensure that the film entertains also. The plot follows the story of a young doorman who thinks he'll go on to bigger things after accepting a job from the local kingpin. He doesn't; the job only lands him in trouble when he fancies a swim and stupidly leaves ten grand on the beach, which is promptly stolen by a couple of kids who have the time of their lives on a shopping spree. However, all is not rosy for our hero; who must find the money or face the consequences...The film is made up of a cast of unknowns; at least, it was back in 1999, as nowadays Heath Ledger is something of a name. He doesn't impress too much here, however, as his performance is mostly of the one-note variety and he doesn't make for a very compelling lead. He fits the movie in that he's Australian and looks naive; but beyond that, he's not the best lead I've ever seen in a movie. If you ask me, Bryan Brown gave the best performance here. He might not have a great deal of screen time, but he steals every scene he's in and it's him that provides the movie with a lot of its humour. He's got nothing to do with the best sequence, however, which takes place in the form of probably the most hilarious bank robbery ever caught on film. On the whole, I can recommend this film to people that enjoy quirky crime films; as the weirdness is plentiful, and the way that events take a turn for the bizarre is enjoyable; but if you're not a fan of this sort of film, I can't really say that Two Hands will float your boat. It's not a must see, but if it's your thing and you get a chance to see it...you probably wont completely regret it.",positive,en
I had never seen such an incredible acting job in a motion picture as I did when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis play Christy Brown in My Left Foot. In fact off the scene his role wasn't even over. He played the role of Christy Brown or at least disabled like him all through the filming of the movie and needed surgery because of the damage his superior acting had done to his back. To me that is remarkable and through all the pain he put up with to act that role I believe it is quite true to say he put on the most Oscar worthy performance in history. He was so masterful in this tough a part that I believe no one could have done it better or with more of an impact than him. Although I cannot say it is the greatest movie of all time I can say that how he played this impossible a role and then kept on acting it until it wasn't even acting anymore is without a doubt the greatest feet I will ever seen an actor do. Probably a man too for that matter.,positive,en

James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words. The tone is everything. He carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of gallows humor. I like the other two actors a great deal too. The blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy stoicism. Some of the thugs seemed a little sketchy but this is a mini-point really. The film is totally solid and Franco is way cool all around.,positive,en

"I was in Houston this past week on business for a conference in the Galleria, an area which has quite a few Starwood properties around it. I settled on the Westin Oaks, a hotel I had stayed at previously a couple years ago that was still undergoing renovations at the time. Back then, my experience was mixed, with the elevators having a mind of their own, the older rooms looking worn out, and the service level was just a hit or miss. Could this time around be any different?
Arriving a couple hours before normal check-in time, I was informed of a room being available and had been upgraded to an Executive King Corner room on the 17th floor. The check-in experience itself was quick, and the agents at the front desk were pleasant to deal with. A couple years ago, the lobby area was only limited to the elevators and the front desk while renovations were going on and the changes were noticeable and quite nice I have to admit. The one big thing one will notice is the major improvement in the elevators, they no longer have a mind of their own and you simply enter the floor number you'd like to be taken to and off you go. The lobby bar area was available this time around, and it had a nice upscale feel to it which was rather enjoyable.
My room itself was a large corner room, with new furnishings that were very similar to other new Westin properties. The bed was indeed ""heavenly"", and I was impressed with the overall look and feel of the room. No longer did these rooms have that worn look to them, and it was obvious that Westin has really done a good job with the room upgrades. The corner Executive King room is very similar to a suite, and is very spacious - one will not be disappointed with it!
Throughout my three night stay, I was able to use in-room dining which was good and much better than my previous stay and the front desk was able to take care of any of my needs. Danny Ruiz, one of the guest relations coordinators had contacted me ahead of my stay asking me if there was anything I would need and made sure my stay was as enjoyable as possible. One of the best things about this hotel is that it's right in the Galleria, so you basically have the mall available to you during business hours and it's very easy to get a quick meal at the food court, walk down to a decent sit-down restaurant, or just pass the time with some shopping or even a bit of ice-skating! As my conference was in the same area, I hardly ever had the need to step outside other than going out to events in the evening. I also had a chance to experience the Business Center which helped me out greatly.
Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this stay and it's great to see the changes that have taken place at this hotel. A couple years ago, I had the kind of experience which was OK at best and I didn't really know how this time would turn around. I'm happy to say though that this hotel has improved greatly after the renovations, and you might even think you're at a completely different place if you've stayed here before. The rooms have been upgraded and are definitely on par with the newer Westin hotels, the service level has improved greatly, and elevators I'm thrilled to say now take you to where you want to go! The staff was wonderful to deal with, and every need I had was taken care of without hesitation. It's amazing how things change after a renovation, and this property has definitely been upgraded. Other Starwood hotels exist around the area, but I'll be staying at the Westin Oaks again as my choice of hotel in Houston.",positive,en

"The hotel is in a great location and generally staff are lovely, especially John the doorman. However at over $300 a night room only (Inc taxes) for an internal facing room it seems expensive. The decor is quirky.
The hotel is great for being on the wharf and next to the cable car stop, but the wharf area is quite seedy. A couple of times I got hassled by people on the street, one very creepy.
Didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast, which again seemed quite expensive at about $18 for a croissant, bagel and 2 coffees, better going to the Starbucks at the back of the hotel.
The sound-proofing between the rooms is not good, I could hear the couple next door chatting through the night/woken up when they did early in the morning.
The wine hour is good and it's nice to get a chance to socialise with the other guests.
Would recommend on the basis could get a deal which would reduce price.",positive,en

"I stayed at the Palace Hotle in July 2011 for one night on a business trip to SF. I was immediately impressed with this hotel from the moment I met the valet.

A great ambassador for the hotel.
The lobby and atrium inside are beautiful. I had breakfast there in the morning (breakfast was pretty pricey- $20 for an omlette) and the waiter gave a history lesson on the hotel, which was very interesting. It was nice to see an employee with such pride in the property where he worked.

"My only issue is that the base of the car seat is pretty wide and therefore can make it very difficult to ...
4.5 stars! I have bought two of these. There were two reason I decided on the Britax Boulevard. 1. It was rated as one of the easiest car seats to install properly. 2. It has an ARB (Anti Rebound Bar) I've read articles that state that the number one cause of injuries to children in carseats is because the car seat is not installed properly. So #1 was extremely important to me. I have had limited experience with other brands, but I can say that the ClickTight helps get the car seat much tighter much easier than some other models. My only issue is that the base of the car seat is pretty wide and therefore can make it very difficult to reach the tether that is used when utilizing the anchors in the car. Some cars are easier than others, but that is probably the only time consuming part of installing and removing the seat. The strap on the tether is difficult to loosen which makes things harder. The only other negative i have to say is that you have to recline the seat before installing. That may be standard for all car seats, but I found that annoying considering how difficult the seat is to remove and loosen when already installed. That is the only reason i give it a .5 star below a 5. My son was very comfortable in this seat almost immediately... I saw a huge difference in his comfort when comparing to the infant only car seat. Overall, for a convertible car seat, I would highly recommend this one.",positive,en

"From making the reservation until the time we walked out of the front door to wander the streets of uptown Charlotte the experience of dining at e2 was simply amazing.\n\nAs Ben said I'm not sure what has held me back from e2 for so long, but I'm glad we went when we did and our experience last night has made a fan of me. We will definitely be back. The food was well thought out and prepared to perfection.\n\nI started out with the Oysters on the half shell which were great. The oysters themselves were perfect which I get that the restaurant just really shucks them and puts them on ice but were a great start to a meal. Prior to the oysters they brought out 2 \""pre appetizers\"" made special by the Chef to entice our appetite. We had a salmon paste type plate....very small but just enough to wake up the ol tastebuds. We then had some sort of risotto, ham and the ever popular chantrelle mushroom small plate that was just bursting with perfection.\n\nMy Co-Diners had the Yellowfin Tuna Spring Rolls which has now taken over as the Best App in Charlotte IMO. Sushi grade tuna, jalapeno, cucumber and a sprig of cilantro to pull it all together. What a great combination of flavor. Also, I was able to sample the Grilled Peach Salad. Surprisingly fresh Georgia Peaches, Mascarpone cheese which really stood out, basil, honey and I'm still not sure what the heck \""Mache\"" is but I do know that I like it. \n\nFor my entree I had the special NY Strip. 14 glorious oz of perfectly cooked NY Strippy goodness. It was marinated perfectly with worchestershire and seasoned to perfection. It had a cippolini onion chutney which when paired together made me start thinking about when I was coming back. \n\nWe finished up with a few desserts for the table. I am not sure who the Master Dessert Chef they have in the back but give him/her a raise! This person is a genious. Banana Cream Pie which had like 6 layers or something. It was nothing short of exemplary and included banana bread, banana pudding, and shaved chocolate. I could have eaten that as my meal. WOW.\n\nSuffice it to say the service was also impeccable.

"Stayed at the Palomar for 4 nights before heading off to Las Vegas.
I found the staff very friendly, we arrived just as the world cup was starting and wanted to catch the games, the staff gave us a list of all the games/what time they were on and what channels they were on. Did find the food expensive but we didn't eat there so can't comment on if it was nice or not.
Location is the winner for this hotel, lots of shops nearby and a few bars/restaurants. We went to fishermans wharf a few times and that means a taxi ride from what i remember it was normally about $12.
The only down fall i found was the size of the rooms they were tiny. Would have preferred a larger room.",positive,en

"This book does not try to take itself too seriously. The author does not bog us down with reams of technobabble, or try to impress us with his knowledge of theoretical physics.It is a good story, filled with well developed and interesting characters. Most importantly, it is funny. As much as I enjoy science fiction, I also enjoy having a good laugh, and I got plenty of both here.Around 80%, there were of number of technical errors with the text, with some paragraphs repeating, and some missing entirely. It could be I got a bad download, or maybe a glitch in my device. Either way, I do not hold that against the author. However, there were a number of grammatical errors which I did find distracting. Still, the book overall was very good, and I will probably read more from this author.",positive,en

"My wife and I came for a weekend stay and picked The New York Palace. First, only folks that know how to drive in New York should. Everyone else take the cabs. There are plenty of them and car storage is crazy expensive. We took the cab route and paid a flat $45 fee from the airport. The hotel is truly impressive and everyone is quite eager to be of service. This is what I thinks sets the hotel apart from others. Check in was quick with no issues. The wait at the elevator lobby was a bit longer than expected, but it is a +30 story hotel serviced by 6 elevators. The room was nice, but not any more special that a good hotel. One item of note is the light switch near the door. We made the mistake of pressing the lower of the three buttons that alerts the floor chamber maid. After a few minutes, a very cheerful lady knocked on the door asking how she could help. We said there was no issue and she guessed we hit the button by mistake and showed us what each button did. Again unexpected good personal service. Our view of was OK, but blocked by a building across the street. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were wonderful. My wife would love to know where they got them. The next day we walked downtown area. This hotel is in the center of everything and blocks from the theater district. We wanted to experience a true New York restaurant and asked the Concierge for help that Friday afternoon for a Saturday night reservation. There are three always at the desk and ready to serve. Being Friday and not having reservations booked in advance, it was not an easy task. Our concierge said he would leave a telephone message with his findings and recommendation. When we finished our walk that day and went back to the room. Like clockwork, there was a message on the phone to check with the concierge desk. Our reservations were set with a paper showing the directions and contact phone number. Again, great personal service. Our Saturday night was great with a show and dinner. Our check out was very easy and quick. The cab ride back to the airport was $42 meter fee. For summary, everyone we met at the hotel was very professional while the room was good, it was more expensive than it's worth.",positive,en
"Ho soggiornato all'SLS x 8 notti tra la fine di Set. 2009 e l'inizio di Ott. ed √® stata un'ottima esperienza.La posizione √® strategica al massimo x una citt√† cos√¨ estesa come Los Angeles;√® a 1 blocco dal Beverly Center,comoda sia x spostarsi verso Santa Monicache verso il Sunset.L'hotel √® nuovissimo e bellissimo.Al frontdesk sono molto gentili e premurosi.
La camera √® molto ben arredata con pareti di specchi scuri ,spaziosa ed ogni tipo di comodit√†.Nel bagno non ci sono i soliti saponi mignon,ma detergenti viso e corpo,creme e balsamo in formato maxi per rendere pi√π agevole e pratico il viaggio di chi soster√† all'SLS.L'accappatoio merita un 10 e lode(sof like silk)!!!! e la doccia √® grande.
Il letto √® veramente molto comodo e per i corridoi c'√® sempre una gradevolissima profumazione .L'hotel √® molto silenzioso in generale.
Il servizio valletto √® molto efficente e ad ogni ritiro dell'auto si √® omaggiati di una bottiglietta di acqua minerale.All'uscita ci sono spesso paprazzi che aspettano eventuali e probabili vip che alloggiano all'SLS.
Molto pratico e bello √® il fatto che dell'hotel fa parte uno spazioso ed elegante locale x drinks,chiacchiere ecc. chiamato Bazar pieno di salottini e luci soffuse generalmente frequentato da gente giovane e cool.

"This hotel is straight out of the 70's. Rooms are dusty, decor is old, yet prices remain high. As a frequent business traveler who stays in many hotels, this hotel was unimpressive. Worse is the service provided to platinum/status members of their frequent stay program. I asked for one hour extension on check-out on a Friday and was told to call back the next day. In fact, they told me to assume that I couldn't.

"This is one powerful film. The first time I saw it, the Scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience. I gave up on it but then acquired the DVD, used the English subtitles when I needed them, and really got into this movie, discovering just how good it is. It is excellent.The widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts, with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of Braveheart, an involving tale of good versus evil. Here, it's Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (evil). Both do their jobs well.Few actors come across as despicable as Roth. Man, you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant, irritating puss. (He is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else's here). Neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure as Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong in here as the female lead. The movie draws you in and gets you totally involved, so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this.",positive,en

I love being surprised by their latest flower display which usually goes along with the season or hoilday. So they probably change the display every month or so. Last weekend to go along with Spring Break they had lovely tulips all over and a glass enclosed butterfly display. WOWIE...CHECK!!! \n\n@}-------}-------- GIRLS LOVE FLOWERS!\n\n3.)

"I was thrilled when I booked this hotel at a bargain rate to attend a conference at the Wyndham Washington, about 8 blocks (10 minute walk) away. (The Wyndham Washington's rate was more than double than at the City Center, even with the reduced rate conference attendees received). Checking in and out were seamless processes, but I didn't have much contact with staff otherwise. The lobby is very attractive with dark, hardwood floors and a large, comfortable seating area. The room I was assigned was a corner room and was extremely spacious (judging from the emergency exit map on my door, the corner rooms are the largest rooms). The bed was, as Wyndham always promises, extremely comfortable, and the bathroom included nice amenities from the Golder Door Spa. The room also had a coffee/tee maker, iron and ironing board, and cable TV, but no mini-bar (although they do set out 2 bottles of water for guests which cost $3.50 each). My room overlooked the rear of the building over some rooftops, a small area with trees, and into some office buildings--very quiet except for noisy vents on the roof. The hotel has a great location next to the Ritz, 4 blocks from DuPont Circle and the Metro there, and 10 blocks from Georgetown.
The only reason I can't give this experience a higher rating is because of the serious state of disrepair in the room. The walls and ceiling had major cracks that had been painted over in a non-matching color (it looked like maybe there had been water damage from the room above). The carpet, although vaccuumed, was so stained and icky looking that I didn't want even my socked feet to touch it. This was a smoking room, and there were multiple cigarette burns in the bedspread, curtains, and couch. Although the shower pressure was fine, the bathroom tiles were stained and cracked, and the wallpaper was peeling. Judging from another review, it sounds like the hotel is being rennovated; I would definitely ask for a newer room if staying here again as the older ones are in truly sad shape (although they may only give the old rooms to people who book bargain prices on-line).
My only other complaint was that housekeeping doesn't seem to have much respect for ""Do Not Disturb"" signs. They banged on my door twice when I had the sign hanging out.
Overall, I was glad to stay here and not at the Wyndham Washington, which has so many conferences and events that their admittedly lovely lobby is like a zoo. Although there was a conference being held at the Wydham City Center while I was there, too, the hotel is much smaller, quieter, and more intimate, and I barely even noticed the conference-goers. I would stay here again, but I would certainly ask in advance for a rennovated room. I would also suggest anyone staying at Wyndham hotels sign up for their free WyndhamByRequest program, which gets you a complimentary bottle of water, drink of your choice, and snack of your choice waiting in your room upon arrival, free local and long-distance calling (!), and 2pm check-out.",positive,en

"Talk about your classics! Ernie Fossilus (the Foss from here on out) came up with a cute and creative trailer totally spoofing Star Wars. This gem is so jammed packed with tributes and gags I laugh every time! Not only that, when Star Wars did a re-issue with new special effects, Hardware Wars did the same! Talk about a spoof that just won't die! There's a reason George Lucas calls this his favorite parody. He was so impressed, he even hired the Foss to work on ""Return of the Jedi"" (Don't believe me, check his entry in IMDb!)This has to be the first, and in my opinion, the best parody ever done. I think the Special Edition was a bit overdone, but on reflection, I think it's PERFECT for the modern day re-release of Star Wars, and goes to prove that sometimes, it's wrong to mess with perfection.Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's well worth your time.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $3 goodbye!

"My teenage daughters and I stayed at the University Inn during a visit to University of Washington for a college tour. The hotel is conveniently located for a walk to the campus (about 10 minutes away). The hotel itself is very pleasant, despite its outward appearance. It has free parking, a free shuttle to several downtown Seattle locations, and complementary afternoon snacks, and breakfasts, as well as tea and coffee available in the lobby at all times. The room ( two queens) was sizeable and clean, with a second vanity. The airconditioning was a little loud, and there was only one bedside reading lamp when there probably should have been one on each side of each bed. These were the only drawbacks to the hotel.
The staff at the hotel is wonderful, and extremely helpful with maps, directions, and record store advice. Valarie in Housekeeping was fantastic, locating and returning an item left behind very promptly. I would highly recommend this hotel, even if you aren't planning on visiting the University, as a very good value.",positive,en

"This place makes my short list of great ethnic restaurants. I get to Scottsdale frequently and this is my 2nd visit to the Persian Room. I will definitely be coming back. I am not an expert on food from this culture but I know what I like. So far, nothing here has disappointed. \n\nThe service is friendly, helpful, polite and has just the right amount of guidance for people like me that are not that familiar with this type of food. We were served by Nico and she was right on with her suggestions. She represents the front of the house very well and my group felt welcome and well attended to by her. The menu is almost overwhelming because of all the choices but everything I tasted was delicious. Hummus and Stuffed Grape Leaves were a couple of favorites as was the house-made flat bread that comes straight out of their oven to the table. The Koobideh and the Chicken Barg were some mains that are recommended and a word to the wise...the portions are quite large. Surprisingly so given the reasonable prices for ethnic authenticity. \n\nThis is not fancy, fine dining but it does get 5 stars from me because it has the total package: Great front-house staff, great food, and great execution of the entire meal.

Certainly it reminds one of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the washing machine sequence?

"We tried out Priceline this time for our weekend in San Diego and Holiday Inn on the Bay was the most appealing hotel option so despite some negative reviews I read on Trip Advisor we figured we'd try it out because the price was so great. We loved it! The hotel is in the best location right across from the cruise ship terminal and you can walk up and down the boardwalk, to Little Italy, SeaPort Village, Horton Plaza mall, Gaslamp (where the bars and clubs are) and the hotel itself is very nice. It may not be a 4 star but it was clean, comfortable and the staff was very friendly. I will note that others reviewed the opaque bathroom sliding door and yes they are that way and very not ""private"" but we thought it was funny. There's a small balcony at least if you need some ""fresh air"" ;-)
The Elephant & Castle Pub has amazing food and awesome bloody mary's ;-) They are a bit pricey but we never did try the cafe a few doors down because we liked the food at the pub so much. It was reasonable I think for a typical meal in San Diego anyway!
The hotel shuttle is right at the airport waiting for you and is only about 5-10 minutes away if not. They shuttle you to the San Diego zoo, Horton Plaza, SeaPort Village, etc. They even shuttled us to SeaWorld one day for less than a cab would have charged so that was very convenient. Like I said most stuff is w/in walking distance anyway.
San Diego in general is great we go frequently and always have fun. I recommend staying in downtown just because it's so convenient.
**TIP: One downfall of the Holiday Inn is they charge $22 a night per parking which is insane. But we had a rental car and never paid the parking fee because even in July there was always a meter available right out front which was free from I think midnight to 8am so factor in simply the cost for the meter after 8am and we got a good deal. Save your money and either park at a meter or go to the 5 star lot right around the block.
We didn't use the pool or the gym (didn't need to with all the walking) but they looked really nice and clean.
Some reviewers mentioned noise from the trains. It is (a ways) behind the hotel but never bothered us at all. We stayed in the front hotel so maybe that makes a difference. The only noise that bothered me was the horn from the cruise ships but that's only because it seemed to always go off right as I walked by and scare the he!! out of me!
SeaPort was awesome. The gardens down there are perfect for a wedding and there are even horse-drawn carriage rides through the park. There are lots of waterfront restaurants, good wines and food, and about 50 some specialty shops with lots of neat things. I heard a lot of great music and even bought cds from a guy playing the pan flute - so beautiful! It's a cool place to walk around for a few hours anyway. Look for the beer stand that sells 32 oz. for $4... definitely a bargain ;-)",positive,en

"Just experienced the New A350-900 Business Class. The Seating and space is First Class almost as big as Emirates First Class Suite but without the Bling Bling Gold and Wood grain. Very Spacious great onboard entertainment. Food was great as always with Singapore have flown the same route many times in A330 which were old and getting tired this is a big step up. Only negative is (but some may like) is that its very private and High seating but you can't really view anybody or any distance in front of you or behind so its like your in a private cocoon.
A big mention to Allison the Singapore duty manager at Adelaide she sorted out a very stressful few days regarding my Wife's Kris Flyer Account that was suspended due to a glitch. 17 Phone calls to Kris Flyer in Singapore everyone making promises but no one coming through it wasn't until last day that my wife even knew she had a return flight! Shame on you Kris Flyer appalling for a world class airline.
Allison sorted and did things outside of the Square and above and beyond her duties. I shouldn't have had to go through Australia or Adelaide to sort it but was left with no Choice if we didn't my wife would be stuck in Malaysia as account unlock didn't come through until 6 days after return flight.
But this review is about the flight not the Airline or Krisflyer. Hence 5 Star",positive,en

"Someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing Paul Naschy's ""Fury of the Wolfman"" to the great Spanish surrealist films, ""L'age D'or"" and ""Un Chien Andelou"". The Naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end. Dali and Bunuel probably loved it, and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off.The film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from A to B to C. Some mishmash about a ""Professor Walterman"" -- his first name, mind you -- who was bitten by a Yeti monster during an expedition to Tibet and hasn't been the same since, which is understandable. One of his jealous colleagues, the insane daughter of the noted Doctor Wolfstein, knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him. But its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast.""Walterman"" flips out, turns into a werewolf, kills a few people, is electrocuted, dies, is buried, unburied, taken to a castle filled with circus freaks, wired to various machines, zapped with assorted electronic effects, injected with potent elixirs, is chained up, turns into a werewolf, a woman in an evening gown with thigh-high Nazi fetish boots whips him, he escapes, helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle, fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe, eventually turns back into a werewolf, and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife. The lady with the Nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her Luger pistol, they die together, and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter, who did nothing. ""Look! What a beautiful day it is!"" ""La furia del Hombre Lobo"" was written by Paul Naschy in a hurry. Original director Enrique Eguilez was fired and replaced by Jos√© Mar√≠a Zabalza, a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production. He was often unable to work (though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script) and Naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited. Zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of Naschy's previous movies, ""Mark of the Wolfman"". The scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different, and helped pad out the runtime after Zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie. Post production was a nightmare. Nobody knew who was doing the editing, the money ran out, the master print disappeared for a while, and then at a pre-release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find Zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater. He was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb.Yet somehow the film works, if you let it. It keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles, vaulted catacombs, chains, whips, gloomy moors. Fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn't make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution. In one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning; in the next shot its bone dry and he's howling at the full moon. Then its raining again. And yet you don't look at it as a gaffe. Its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible, opposites are the same, and effects proceed causes; First the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams, and then the cable starts sparking with electricity. People say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness -- I say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend. It is a marvel of making something out of nothing, and succeeds not because of what it could of had, but because of what it does. It's easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it. The trick is being able to see through the mayhem, or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect.Paul Naschy died last week at the age of 75. He had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more, was working on film projects right up until his last days, but passed away in Madrid, Spain, with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment. His rich, varied, and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest. And yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like ""Fury of the Wolfman"" in rapt awe. Even people who don't like Euro Horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at, if only for just a minute in a couple spots. You can find it for free at Archive.Org or even buy it on a DVD for a nickel. It's worth far, far more.Amusingly, Naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted, sick, demented little movie as a classic, if not an outright masterpiece of Cinema Dementia. The problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for Naschy to forgive. I would never presume to dare to forgive it for him, but I will say this: I'd rather watch ""Fury of the Wolfman"" in its dingiest, most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing, obnoxious crap churning out up at the Swine Flu cineplexes this or any other weekend.The world lost a great artist this month. Watch his films, and remember.9/10",positive,en

The restaurant is an attraction of its own, and the bar is something right out of The Great Gatsby, complete with its original, back-lit Quartz bar.

"Amsterdam to Taipei via Xiamen. Flown for the first time with this airline, good seating and IFE system. The food was tasty and abundant. Fight attendants are professional and worked efficiently. Both flights were on time. My luggage couldn't be checked through all the way to Taipei, so I had to collect my luggage at Xiamen and check in again. This means twice immigration procedures and twice security checks, queueing and waiting at Xiamen. Quite unnecessary on 2016 standard. The lavatories on their 787 were very cramped. I am 5'7"" and barely could turn around without hitting anything. The lavatories were kept reasonably clean during the flight.

"I always enjoy watching this cartoon, with Sylvester trying to catch Tweety on a train, rather than at Grandma's house. It's actually a standard fare, but entertaining, especially when Tweety pulls the emergency stop cord. One of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train. When you watch this over and over, like my little boy did (who loves trains, which is why he liked it so much), you begin to notice some things.Throughout this short, the position of the baggage car changes on the train, either 3rd, 4th or 5th, and in long shots not at all. The engine has either the number 651 or 814, or none at all. The coal tender has either the number 99, or the letters ""S.P. & Q.R."" on it, or no number or letters at all. The coaches carry the ""S.P.Q.R."" without the ""&"" in long shots, and then in closeups it has the words ""SouthEast and Western.""All of this doesn't interfere with the story, but the production details were obviously not looked into very carefully. Still this cartoon is among my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.",positive,en

The girls got in for free, but the guys were charged $40. \n\nThe crowd was a little older (28-30+) & they were playing a lot of throw-backs that night. It all worked out though, because you can gamble on the other side of the club!! \n\nGenius layout planning. They've incorporated a pool into the club & the bar flanks both sides of the club - making it easy to always get a drink. \n\nThis is definitely a place to check out at some point. \nThe club is very extravagant - very Vegas!",positive,en

"I'm giving this place 5 stars. The Boyfriend & I decided to randomly try a new place (his idea) and I know he loves Brazilian steakhouses... So I steered us toward this place. At first we weren't sure what to think.. The place looks empty when you walk in, but actually almost every table had people. It took a little bit to get a table, but obviously they were busy. She sat us at a booth, which was perfect for us. The salad bar is significantly smaller than other Brazilian steakhouses but the Stroganoff is out of this world. Best I've ever had! The Boyfriend really liked the grape leaf wrapped something or other. I didn't try them so I have no idea. \nThey started bringing out the meat & one of the guys really stood out. So much personality. Later we realized he was the owner. \n\nThe Boyfriend really liked one of the chicken skewers, but obviously the red meats were the standouts. No one gave us tongs, so it was a little weird getting the meat from the server, but they worked it out. \n\nThe meat selection is similar to other Brazilian steakhouses, but I do think they could do with some sharper knives. Meat quality is good, not great but definitely good. \n\nThis place is definitely a family owned restaurant with the good & bad qualities that go into that. For me personally, eating out is about the experience just as much as food quality and this place goes out of their way to give good experience. Towards the end of the night the owner was singing karaoke and encouraging everyone to get up and sing. Normally that's not really my thing, but something about all the positive energy really made it a lot of fun. When we left everyone was having fun drinking and dancing around. It was a lot of fun.",positive,en

"Do you like good food, good service and sports? Check this place out! \n\nThe restaurant is plastered with sports memorabilla, mainly baseball. The atmosphere is very lively and the crowd, well the crowd is mainly older (50+). However, being in my early 30's, my wife and I really enjoyed our time at Don and Charlie's. The server was very helpful and upbeat. We never went without a full glass of water or asked by multiple people if we needed anything else, keep in mind the place was packed. \n\nThe food was awesome. I went for the prime rib and it melt in my mouth! I went medium-rare but rare may have been a better option. My wife had the schnitzel, somewhat of an odd choice at a steak house/BBQ place, but it was very tender and had a nice flavor. Not getting salad or soup with your entree was strange, you get a huge bowl of coleslaw. It was very good, but different, I believe a salad will cost you a little more. The potato options are great as well. Overall, if you are looking for a nice meal with midwestern flair, stop on by. I will say you will drop some money, but you get a ton of food in return.",positive,en

"Works Great!!
Ordered this USB 3.0 to HDMI cable for my Microsoft Surface tablet. The Micro HDMI port was damaged and this seemed like a great alternative vs. buying a whole new laptop. I was a bit skeptical at first on if this would work as I've only ever dealt with HDMI connections but it worked like a charm. I think what I was most impressed with this purchase however was the support that came with the product which I think is unusual for a low value accessory. I had initial issues with the connection so I emailed support and they responded quickly having me check my HDMI cord. Sure enough I had a bad HDMI cord and replacing it was the solution. Don't expect a extreme support but getting any support with an accessory is a plus! An important thing to remember is this may not be the best solution for a computer or tablet with minimal USB ports and you will need an HDMI cable to connect as one is not provided but this saved me a lot of repair money or new tablet money. Happy with my purchase.",positive,en

"Hello, I was alanrickmaniac. I'm a Still Crazy-holic. It was just another movie I watched partly on TV. Then I had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends. Then I wanted the DVD, because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to lay my hands on the soundtrack. Then on several film posters and the film script. Right now it has become that worse that I try to push other people into addiction with my website and Still Crazy parties. How could that happen? What drove me into addiction? OK, it's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the British can produce. Alright, the movie is worlds apart from stuff like ''This Is Spinal Tap'', because of the characters, that aren't childish or ultra cool, but real. This is a story about men getting older, too. A story about men getting along with each other. Or don't. It contains some of the best actors possible. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy who puts on one of the best performances I've ever seen in a film.Good, the soundtrack is unbelievable. Foreigner's Mick Jones has written the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail who plays bass-man Les Wickes and Bill Nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer Ray Simms are really singing. We know that about Jimmy Nail, but if you've only heard Bill Nighy's singing in ""Love Actually"", you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is. Well, you'll fever for every scene to come for the x-th time, especially those concert scenes. You'd die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when Strange Fruit is doing ""All Over The World"", singing on the top of your lungs. You long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real Strange Fruit at Wisbech's festival stage. It's hard but... I'm addicted to this film. I'm addicted to Strange Fruit. If there's a world where this band really exists I'd like to move there. Got Still Crazy... anyone?",positive,en

Bought these phones to replace a Galaxy S5 and a flip phone for my husband. The phones arrived in a couple days and were in pristine condition.

From there everything was handled personally, quickly and without any hassle what so ever!!! We spoke directly by phone a number of times, so the process was smooth from the start.

"I'm a long time fan of the IC Barclay on the eastside of Park Ave, so when this hotel opened two years ago, I was hesitant to stay there. It's smaller - much smaller, although taller, much taller. But the front desk staff and bellmen were OUTSTANDING. We tried out two rooms for this stay. The first was an executive king and was larger than the corner king we had the second night. I love a wall of windows, but the executive was nicer. There isn't, however, that impressive feel that you're at an intercontinental. It's very Westin-like, which is sad because i can get that next door at the Westin Times Square. The views are outstanding. The details done right. We'll be back because of the location - just far enough from Times Square (it's close, not on Times Square) that it's not noisy, gritty or dirty, yet close enough to hit the theatres - they're right there. There was a wonderful street fair on 8th ave the Sunday we were there. good and bad: Beds are uncomfortable, rain showers, and the internet costly. The concierge helped with theatre tickets, but the bar closed really early.",positive,en

In fairness, I've only been reading the paper for a few days, so maybe there will be delivery problems in my future. If so, I'll update this review. But so far so good. I'm considering a move to Austin, and I expect to learn a lot about the area by reading the local paper. This is a really good small newspaper.",positive,en

"We stayed at the Westin Boston for an anniversary weekend because the site of our wedding reception (the Seaport) was booked and we are so glad we did! Our weekend begin at check-in where we met guest services agent Nick Cintas who could not have been more kind and gracious. Upon hearing it was our anniversary he upgraded our room giving us an amazing view of the city! We had cocktails at MJ O'Connors (on site) and the staff there could not have been more attentive and fun. Upon returning to our room after dinner, there was a complimentary bottle of champagne waiting for us. Simply a wonderful weekend at a beautiful hotel where clearly service and attentiveness is their first priority. I highly recommend the Westin Boston.",positive,en

"I work in the area and we order Mi Pueblo at least once a week. I always get the shrimp tacos. They are so good! The tartar sause it comes with is so awesome. Great portions also. I've had the ceviche which surprisingly tasted like my mom makes and I've never trusted a place with making ceviche but this one is great! Another favorite around here is the Mi Pueblo Chicken salad. It's simple but the avocado dressing is mouth watering good. Their fresh chunky salsa is my favorite. Always fresh with just a little kick to it. The spicy green salsa is also very good but caution because it can be SPICY! The chips that come with for dipping are also delicious. Rice are great, black beans great, refried beans great, carne asada great also. Have not tried the enchilada style though. There's not one down side that I can think of and recommend this place to anyone. Wish I could try everything on the menu but it's hard to steer away from the Shrimp Tacos because they are the best I've had anywhere",positive,en

"I'm currently at this hotel, and don't understand all the bad reviews. The check-in was quick and pleasant, the room is clean and adequately stocked (although the towels are a bit thin), the furniture is nice (looks fairly new), and the bed comfortable. The linens on the bed are clean and acceptable.
The immediate block surrounding the hotel is industrial, but if you go 3 or 4 blocks in any direction, it becomes a quite pleasant residential area. There is a big selection of restaurants in the area, but if you prefer, there is a large Kroger Superstore within 2 miles so you can just stock up the in-room fridge and use the microwave to heat things up.
I would definetly stay here again, and would recommend to friends and clients (I am a travel agent) that need a nice, inexpensive place to stay that is close to downtown Houston, without being right in downtown.",positive,en
"Having known and loved this book since I was eleven I was terrified to see it coming up as a movie - what if they'd made a dreadful mess of it? In the event I needn't have worried at all. Everyone was very well cast and the acting is terrific, it followed the story very well except for the strange addition of the scene in the prison, which to me added nothing at all. However it really is the most beautiful love story and I'm so glad I videoed it so I can watch it again and again. My only gripe is - why didn't they give Kester a green waistcoat 'which made him such a personable man'? Such a simple thing, when they went to so much trouble for everything else. If you get the chance, see this, it is excellent.",positive,en

"If you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. But if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation, come on in!In this cartoon, Popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what looks like a Japanese fishing boat. The two Japanese fishermen trick Popeye into thinking that they want a peace treaty signed. But looks can be deceiving; the fishing boat turns out to be a Japanese navy ship! What follows is considered today to be morale-boosting propaganda.Be forewarned, the representations of the Japanese in the film are done in a mean-spirited fashion. Keep in mind, though, that there was a war going on at the time. But I strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the WWII era.",positive,en

"Sammi, Curr a metal rock god, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, the tried to censor his music!! (much like the real life Dee Snider, from Twisted Sister,[Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) Killed in a fire, Sammi Cure was suppose to play on halloween at his old high school for a dance.. Now Eddie Weinbauer , his #1 fan, and the only one who knew how sammi was, and what he felt (or did he?) Nuke, the d.j. at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gives the only copy of Sammi's last record Eddie.. But when Eddie tries to play the record backwards, he finds Sammi talking to him from the dead, and telling him what to do to get back at the bullies at his school that hate him and his music.. Everything works out until, Sammi starts to kill!! A great movie and must see for heavy metal hairband fans, with a great sound track by Fastway, and just in case you don't know what The songs sound like or know Fastway and doesn't like them, they changed there voice a bit and there style as well to sound like the more known Cinderella, or Ratt.. Is the movie a true horror movie? Well that depends on what you call a horror movie, To me a true horror movie is a slasher, with lots of killing, or just plain be scary.. This movie is neither, not enough deaths, but it can't be called a action, comedy, drama, suspense, or thriller, so that is why I would guess it has to be a horror.. So if you wanna ""Rock N' Roll, Rockin' on the mid night steel your soul!!"" Than Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat is the for you.. I mean ""what are you afraid of? It's only Rock 'N' Roll!?!""",positive,en

"Governments are elected for three year terms, as Reg Whithers said in 1973, the Liberals were determined to continue forcing Labor to the Polls until they were defeated. If you ask me, this is portrayed in the docudrama, but, anyone who says Kerr acted properly in this fails to acknowledge the self-serving and costly strategy of the Liberal Party of Australia. On the series itself, I though Max Phipps was a poor Whitlam, his voice was too ghostly. Also, more of the key political players on both sides should have been used, though this may have been a reflection of budgetary constraints at the time. Nevertheless, I recommend it, with caution.",positive,en

I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on. It brings back happy times for me. I grow up in a big city in the mid-west. It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same. It makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost. The big mama's of day are under the age of 55. Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past. The music was great in this movie. I truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters I would have paid to see it. As I viewed the movie for the second time I figured out who life this movie was about. He did an superb job in writing and producing this film. I guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you. As soon as I can I will be obtaining a copy for my home use. I alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than. Thanks for such a great movie.,positive,en
"Booked via Marriott website using rewards points e-certificate. Used free airport shuttle but it seems to be a 20-30 minute circuit wait. Check in was efficient and information was correct. They provided a free upgrade to a suite. Suite was roomy, well equipped, clean and functioning but layout could be made slightly more efficient. Although table lamp on writing desk has readily accessible charging points, its near the door to the room in a separate area well away from the bed. I believe it is more efficient to have the lights near bed also have multiple charging plugs so phones and tablets can be charged and within ready reach when urgent calls come through and also allow phone wake up alarms well within hearing range (I dislike having to move beds and tables to access power plugs) I also used hotel wake up service and it was prompt.

"Claire Booth Luce's ""The Women"" shows relationships with men through a woman's point of view in a play, (and 1939 film that also has Joan Crawford playing a bitch: a character who might have been Amanda Farrow 20 years before), that has no male characters. Here we see the male characters and what a bunch they are. They use women like toys and throw them away, leaving the women to suffer. Ironically, the women in ""The Women"", perhaps because they are all we see, are shown in a less than favorable light, alternately silly and scheming, with the only ""nice"" one, (Norma Shearer), growing ""claws"" by the end. In ""The Best of Everything"" we see the men for the cads they are while the women are largely innocent and vulnerable.This is a film about women leaping from things. Diane Baker leaps from a car, (in perhaps the most absurd scene in cinema history, which is not in the book). Suzy Parker falls from a fire escape. The women in the film are leaping into the workplace, looking for success and love at the same time. Women would leap into the future and leave this type of soap opera behind in the next decade. But they would come back to it in the 80's and 90's through the novels of people like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz, (although their trashier works aren't as good as this).The best thing about this film is the way it looks. I love the glossy cinemascope films of the 50's and 60's. They look so much better than the pixel-challenged home movies we've been making since, especially in the letterboxed version we see on TV, and the DVD, with the picture so clear you could walk into it. The look of the bevy of young beauties in it is also memorable. This film probably has more beautiful women in it than any other. It has a supermodel, (Suzy Parker), a beauty queen, (Myrna Hansen, who was not Miss America 1954 as Rona Jaffe says in the DVD commentary but rather Miss USA 1953, per the IMDb: but so what), and a Playboy playmate, (June Blair, from January 1957). My vote goes to Suzy, one of the astonishing beauties of all time. Her acting here isn't as awful as people pretend: they are just reacting, as people did then, to the sight of a supermodel, (the first, really), trying to act. Nobody seemed to care how well she did. Her role, that of an apparently worldly woman who turns out to be the most vulnerable, is the most complex in the bunch and she does just fine.The most touching thing about the film now is the age of the female leads at the time. Hope Lange was 27 when they filmed this in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20. Suzy Parker was 26. Hope, who looked to be Grace Kelly's heir, never made it really big and wound up being Mrs. Muir on television and, per the IMDb, wound up living in a home with ""crates for coffee tables"" because she spent her money on causes she believed in before dying at age 72 in 2003. This film must have seemed a very distant and irrelevant memory to her by then. Baker, always a welcome face in 60's TV, (especially to Richard Kimble), and still active as an actress and acting coach, just turned 67. Parker found ""the best of everything"" with Bradford Dillman for 40 years before dying at age 70 the same year Lange did. But here they are, young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, just like their characters.",positive,en

"Having been brought up in Phenix City as a child, I recognize many of the local people in the movie, so for me, it's like a trip down memory lane to see ""The Phenix City Story"" again. As a matter of fact, my granduncle is in it in one of the very first scenes. Uncle Drew's the one in the Hawaiian shirt who scoots his chair out to get a better look at the singer/stripper.Unless you've been there, like Mr. Page and I both have, you couldn't possibly understand the story it tells. The reviewer from New York calls John Patterson racist, most likely without ever having had an encounter with Mr. Patterson or his father. And what is your point in bringing up Mr. Patterson's employment now? It has nothing to do with the film that you're supposedly reviewing. How in the world can you sit back and judge either them or this film when you've probably gone no further yourself than the south Bronx? It's been my experience that people who do that are simply attempting to feel morally superior to the folks portrayed in the movie. By most accounts of the time, both Mr. Pattersons were basically good and decent men. Their families were respectable people, as were most of the people who lived in Phenix City.By the way, why is so hard for those who live outside of the south to believe that there are good and decent people even in small towns in Alabama? And why do they assume that everyone living in a small southern town is a racist? My parents lived there and yet, they didn't tolerate it in our household. Others didn't tolerate it either, but the myth that everyone in the south is racist lives on through the willful ignorance of others.The movie itself is simple and direct. It isn't the whole story --- Hollywood added a certain sensationalism when the film was made. Parts of it were absolutely on target. Other parts of it bordered on fairy tales. And if it's the source that anyone uses to decide how folks in small southern towns are, they need to get a grip and understand what most of us do --- it's ONLY a movie.",positive,en
"Taco Tuesday, anyone? Well make that Taco Thursday, too! That's when I discovered this lovely place.

I was soooo full after half of my quesadilla and 2nd taco but I kept going because it was so good. We went at around 6PM and the sun was still out.

Excellent location in the Back Bay area with a 5 minute walk to the Prudential Centre shopping mall and access to the ' T ' only 1 block away. The hotel is within easy reach of all the shops,cafes and restaurants on Newbury Street as well as the delightful Boston Common.
The hotel is very welcoming and the bedroom was nice, large and clean. The furnishing's were nice and new and the bathroom was a good size with L'occatiane products and an impressive shower.
The hotel bar, 'Cuffs', is handy for a drink after you've hit the shops and the food served there is very nice. We also ate in the hotels Stanhope Grill Restaurant on News Year Eve which was superb.

The coffee and cupcakes are awesome, the atmosphere is equally as good, and with free wi-fi and comfortable seating this one of my favorite places to do homework or just chill.

There are literally 2 off-street parking spots, and the rest is park at the curb...lucky me I am one of the fortunate ones living within walking (or biking) distance. The coolest thing about this place though is Bill the owner, and the rest of his friendly staff. I've frequented other coffee shops in the area, and don't frequent them anymore specifically because of the pretentious, snobby staff at those establishments. From the first day I walked in to Copper Star however, Bill was super friendly striking up a conversation and really making me feel welcome.

"Well my gal booked this place as a pre v-day getaway for just us to be alone. Upon arrival everything seemed great. The valet was very nice but when we got up to the room it became a different story real quick. The room was filthy, The bed looked like it was layed in, the floors were dirty and the bathroom was still dirty from the previous guest. The ottoman had a huge stain on it that was just vile. So we went down and asked for a new room. We looked at 2 other rooms which included the best room they had to offer and all the same filth everytime. In there top room there was still blue painters tape left on the walls where they stopped painting. Come on really. Now I understand its a 4 star hotel but its not a one star. So we asked for our money back., The front desk was very understanding and courteous. We ended up staying at the Omni hotel that night and were very happy with our stay.",positive,en

"The first night my friends and I were in Vegas, I kept saying we had to go here. They weren't all that excited.. until we started eating. My boyfriend said, while half way through his burger \""it's not gone but i miss it already.\"" \n\nWe had a party of 6, and we called in for reservations, they said it was going to be about an hour. No biggie, we're in Vegas, we passed time. \n\nThree of us got the Kobe Beef burger: AMAZING. I was VERY skeptical about this meat. I really didnt understand the big deal. BOY WAS I WRONG. It was like steak in burger form. Oh lord. One of us got cinnamon bacon. Yes, i just said CINNAMON BACON. (They have many types: Black pepper, jalapeno bacon, cinnamon bacon, ..and i cant remember the other two)\n\nTwo of us got the Surf n Turf burger, with the lobster tail. They were in heaven. One of them got the shallot and wine reduction sauce, which she was VERY pleased with.\n\nThe last person got a veggie burger, sadly to say, i dont think she enjoyed it much. But c'mon, there's nothing better than real meat anyway. \n\nThere was very little conversation throughout dinner, which one of us had brought up, but we had decided it was due to the fact that everyone couldnt stop eating!\n\nWe got zucchini fries which were, absolutely delicious. They weren't super thick, nor super thin. The breading was crunchy, and herby, with the soft (yet firm) veggie inside. \n\nAs for the dessert burgers, eh, they were ok. Not needed, nothing to write home about. \n\nThe price can be anywhere from $12-60 per burger. It all depends on what you put on it of course (for example, lobster and black truffles will be hella expensive. Where as asparagus and pesto will be much cheaper.)\n\n\nGo here. Get the Kobe beef. Enjoy. And sob endlessly when you've finished it. :D",positive,en
"Upon arriving, we waited quite a while for the bellman to assist us. They were still checking guests out when we arrived. In spite of our early arrival, the hotel gave us a room and a very friendly bellman helped us to our room. The hallway smelled of sewage, but the city those two days were especially smelly too. The hallways and lobby were clean and well-lit. The room smelled much better but the rooms were very small. Arron in parking was very helpful, kind and courteous. All the help bent over backwards to make our stay enjoyable. Starbucks in the lobby was a plus, a mall across the street and Trader Joe's and Whole Foods a short walk away. A walk to the lake was very easy, we used the steps outside the hotel to get to the street, then walked a few blocks to Lake Michigan.",positive,en

"We arrived at 7 AM, anticipating only being able to have the hotel hold our luggage while we began exploring the city, but both of our rooms were ""ready"" when we got there. The hotel is exactly as picuted online. Unlike many other hotels which look very nice in the pictures, but once you get there the rooms are not very nice or things are in poor condition, you will get what you expect with this hotel.
There is nothing special nor bad about the location of this hotel if you are a tourist. No matter where you stay, you will likely have to take a taxi or subway to see a number of the sights. Times Square and Central Park were walkable from here. Chinatown, Battery Park, 9/11 Memorial will have to find transportation. The location was a nicer part of town with plenty of restaurants nearby.
One of us recieved the room we booked, but the other couple got a smaller-than-booked room with no explanation. It was not a big deal because the room was still large enough and just as well equipped. Neither rooms had a good ""view"". We did have to change rooms the second night thanks to the rooms on either side of us partying until 3AM. We were upgraded to a larger room with an excellent view the second night. City noise was not too bad in either room. The beds were not particularly comfortable and the linens were not particularly high end. I would say they were overall average Mariott quality. In general, everything was the quality of an average Mariott with higher end decor
There was complimentary coffee in the restaurant all day, but they seemed to have a really tough time keeping up with the demand of a hotel that size and it was not high on their priority list, so we often had to wait a few minutes for more cups or coffee.",positive,en

"Le Meridien Philadelphia is a beautifully styled hotel in a historic urban building, located right across the street from City Hall in a very central location. The design sensibility is clean and modern (much like the W Hotel brand), and the staff is courteous and efficient. Rooms are spotless and chic, although style seems to trump comfort (modern, angular furniture not quite suitable for lounging, and a somewhat sterile air). Bed is the exceptionally comfortable type typical of Starwood properties, however, and the bathroom is bright and spacious. The room rate was a very good value, and hotel services like in-room dining an minibar were surprisingly reasonable. Even though my room faced a busy downtown street, it was very quiet, so they have sound-proofed well. The only drawback of the place is the block it's on: the family court and McDonald's a few doors down seem to draw a collection of unsavory people hanging around on the sidewalk at all hours. I am a big, strong guy accustomed to urban life, so it didn't bother me too much to walk the block alone at night, but it might be unsettling for some travelers,",positive,en
"This hotel is very convenietly located right across from the Colts stadium and within walking distance of many attractions. We were excited when we arrived. However that excitment faded when our daughter took out a blanket and found it covered in long hairs. More hairs were found on the bed spread and on the bathroom floor. When confronted the front desk, they said the hotel was full but they would send up someone to sweep. They said it would be an hour because their cleaning person was also their shuttle driver. Several hours later we were still waiting. We once again went to the front desk and was told the cleaning person had left for the evening. They offered us new sheets but said we would have to put them on ourselves. They also made the comment that ""Like most hotels, we wash our comforters quarterly""...there is a ""comforting"" thought!
All in all, the staff did not seem suprised about the issue and really showed no eagerness to set it right. They did provide a slight discount to our bill, but I would have rather paid full price for a clean room!",positive,en
"We really enjoyed our stay here for 2 nights in Sept 2009 partly because the suite was so big and we had a King bed, but also because we like the surrounding area in Dupont Circle, not to mention ""Happy hour"" and the ease of using public transport to get there.
We took a taxi from Union Station, having arrived by train from NYC. The taxi cost $16 and only took about 10 mins to get to the hotel. Check in was easy and quick and in no time at all, we were out and about enoying the sights of Washington.
If you like walking, the White House is an easy 20 mins away, and the Mall, about another 15 mins further. After we'd walked here and checked out one of the Museums, we jumped on the Metro and easily found our way back to Dupont Circle and the hotel again in time for Happy Hour and a free drink - bliss.
Nibblies were provided - basically nachos with salsa and sour cream which everyone seemed to enjoy. Breakfast was included in the price and there was a good selection from cereals, bagels, muffins, bread/toast to cook your own waffles, made to order cooked breakfast items (omelettes etc) or choose from the baine-marie. Oh and by the way, fish feeding is at 9am so if you have kids, no doubt they'll enjoy that !!
There was free internet access provided at kiosks which unfortunately you had to stand at, as well as a small shop which had the usual stock - chocolates for late night snacks, postcards etc.
We also took advantage of the fact that there was also a do-it-yourself laundry which was really appreciated if like us, you've been doing quite a bit of travelling and need to wash and dry in a hurry.
All up, a great stay in a great city.",positive,en
"Amazing seitan wings! Doublewide is a fun party restaurant with great variety of gourmet food rich in flavor. It's so nice to see so many clearly labeled vegetarian and vegan options on their menu.

The bar section was actually much quieter. But being a party restaurant that's exceptionally fun themed, one shouldn't expect this type of place to be quiet.",positive,en

"This is a super dog friendly, new-ish, local brewery. We came here on Friday night and took the light rail down. Can't comment on parking. It's just a short walk off the lightrail through an industrial neighborhood. Weird location but I guess you have to start somewhere.\n\nThere was a food truck outside, but since we already ate (see my review of Vida), we just drank. My husband got the Double IPA Babymaker (actually, I believe he got 2). As a newlywed couple without kids, we had alot of fun making fun of that drink name. I had the smoked amber. I thought the smoked amber was just ok, but I loved the double IPA. So good. We were actually playing rock paper sissors at the end of the night to see who could get the last sips of the Babymaker. The brewery is pretty cool. They also have a decent size warehouse where they hold events (been to a few before and they had beer, music, food, cornhole, etc). Chill place plus you get to play with dogs!\n\nMy only complaint about this place is that they close so early. They close at 9....even on the weekends. On Friday, when they called last call, there were still 25-30 people at the place. Totally losing a bunch of money by closing so early. We would have chilled there for another hour or so and bought more beer.",positive,en

"I am writting in reference to our stay in the courtyard marriott/blackstone in downtown Ft. Worth this past week. We parked our car with the valet at the hotel and have some concerns over what may have taken place while our car was in the garage. My fiance proposed to me the day of our check in and the ring box was sitting in the center console glove compartment along with some papers/bills. We specifically checked the where abouts of our box and bills before we left our car with the valet for our over night stay. When we got our car back the following morning, we looked in the console and the box was moved, upside down and open which was not the way we left it. Also in the back seat our cup holder, which you can close in and upward postion to be a part of the middle seat was folded up, had a drink in there and the drink was smashed and spilled into the seat because someone put the cup holder up. For no reason should our cup holder have been moved, it was not in the way of our bags. Also some of my fiances cd's were missing out of his cd book. This was all noticed as soon as we got into our vechicle after picking it up from the valet. Our vehicle was left in valet from 7pm until 9am the following morning, at no time did we get our car between the time we checked in or checked out. We both saw the sign that stated the hotel was not responsible for electronics left in the car and we choose not to file a police report due to the waste of time it would have been for both parties. I do however want to express my disappointment with the marriott's staff as I can only imagine that was who was responsible for our dissheveled car and missing cd's considering all items where accounted for at the time the vehicle was dropped off at the valet. I have stayed in marriott hotels through out the past year and this is puzzeling to us as we have not had any problems before hand. I only hope that the marriott will address this situation and hopefully avoid it for all customers in the future sake.",positive,en

My son thought that the sofa bed was not quite as comfortable as he would have liked but that is to be expected from a fold out bed.

"I spent LOTS of time reading reviews here, and thankfully, there were good reviews about this hotel, and location was one of the top priorities for this trip.
We were happy with our room rate, although we booked rather last minute, and the only type of room available was a king bed with a sleeper sofa. This was not my 1st pref. but we just put the kids on the sleeper sofa. We were only there for one night. Yes, the valet charge was a bummer, and the only thing I noticed was that it took them a long time to move our car from the street in front of the hotel to wherever they store them.
The room was fairly clean and quiet. The lobby is very pretty and the staff was friendly and helpful. They gave the kids ""goodie bags"" when we first checked in. We didn't let the kids open them until we were in for the night.
The conceirge at the hotel was wonderful. I spoke with her A LOT about everything and she had answers for everything and she was very elegant and treated us with respect and she was very sweet with the children. You could tell she enjoys her job.
She recommended several places for dinner and we ended up choosing a restaurant called Jones. (Jones-restaurant) It was a very hip retro style restaurant with GREAT food. They have no kids menu specified, but they could order selections from an adult entree and they would just bring part of it. But some things on the menu were very kid friendly. My daughter had tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. My son had fried chicken and french fries - his portion was a bit large. My other daughter had grilled cheese and chips. See photos of food.
The hotel is within walking distance of many sight seeing things from a historical perspective. We happened to be in the right place at the right time and were near liberty plaza during an open house of independence hall, so we did not have to wait and get tickets etc. The tour guide was awesome. He was a great communicator and very knowlegable and easy to hear and understand. He involved the children and kept their attention.
We also splurged on a 20 min. horse and buggy ride through the historic district. This was great because they are not just letting you ride and look, they give you a running commentary on the history and they know lots of little neat tidbits of info that you may not have known or they point out things you may not have noticed. I wish we would have paid for a longer tour. We paid $30 for 20 min. There was a sign that said tips were appreciated, so I tipped $5. My kids were thrilled because this is something they would like to do in NYC, and we never have, so it was a treat.
The new visitors center is awesome and the gift shops all around are great. The one at the Betsy Ross house and the National parks building are 2 we visited. If you have lots of money to spare, there are adorable historical dolls for purchase at the National parks gift shop. Ben Franklin, and other colonial looking dolls. They start at like $90 each, though. I wish I would have splurged on one, because they were beautifully made. But, no, I did not.
However, we never made it to the Rittenhouse square area, shopping area or other areas in the city. But having never been there, I'm not sure what I was missing. Our location was close enough that we could walk down to Penn's Landing.
The Liberty Bell was great. The display for it now is beautiful. It's cool to see Independence Hall behind it through the window when you are inside looking at it.
Also, a couple of doors down on the block of the hotel entrance there is a tiny shop that sells ice cream and water ice (slushees). On the opposite corner there is a COSI. We went to both places.
If you are there with kids to see the historical things, I would highly recommend this hotel. I booked over the phone with the hotel ""headquarters,"" and they were careful to ask about what type of view and what floor in addition to smoking or non, beds, etc. If we return we will stay there.",positive,en

I saw this film at the Sundance Film Festival and I too was surprised that it didn't generate more notice because it was not only powerful and beautifully crafted but very original. The audience was totally engaged and the greatest part of seeing a film like this at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and cast in the Q&A session afterward. They literally had to throw us out of the screening room for the next film - we could have gone on for a lot longer. The film is thought provoking and hilarious at the same time. It will be a shame if this film isn't picked up for wider distribution - I hope it will at least become available on DVD because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I know.,positive,en

"This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by Harriet Hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and/or shared between the principals. As usual the storyline needn't detain us though for the record it was based on a play, Shore Leave, that also served as the basis for a Broadway Musical, Hit The Deck. Anyone who actually saw Shore Leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the movie but what matters, as always, is the music, lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle. It's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1) we get to see Astaire play the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs, one of which, I'm Building Up To An Awful Let-Down, had a lyric by Johnny Mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman, albeit an ex-hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner Ginger before the story starts. He gets to perform a little-known but excellent Berlin number, I'd Rather Lead A Band as well as duetting on I'm Putting All My Eggs In One Basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of World War II were already being felt - Let's Face The Music And Dance, one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team. So what if Randolph Scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and Harriet Hilliard doesn't exactly set the screen on fire; we came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is, do they deliver. Answer: In spades.",positive,en
"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights and had a great experience. Loved the location, so many sites, restaurants, and stores within walking distance.

"The submarine used was NOT Varangian! 'It' was in fact two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945. The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact, the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted out....There are some extremely realistic moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class. As no S-class submarines survive, the shots of them (as P61) and of the depot ship ""Forth"" form part of an interesting record now, as well as an excellent film.",positive,en

"I've avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy. Having been born too late to see 'Hair' in its contemporary setting, I have just been familiar with the UK and Broadway cast recordings for many years; and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little creaky but still, great fun.The film. It drops some of the songs (The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills) and cuts others (Walking in Space). However, what is left is presented very well indeed. All the singers and dancers are excellent, and the key performers (especially Treat Williams as Berger, Beverley D'Angelo as Sheila, John Savage as Claude) are memorable.As a hippy celebration and anthem, 'Hair' manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late. It was no longer the era of peace, love, and Biba, but the time of punk rock ... although watching this film now, in the time of Iraqi problems, gives a new resonance to the Vietnam issues of the 1960s.Milos Forman, who also made 'Amadeus', did a good job on directing. In its scope and feel it reminds me of Norman Jewison's 'Jesus Christ Superstar', especially with the joy of the 'Aquarius' scene and the intimacy of 'Easy To Be Hard'.I really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era.",positive,en

"I would only recommend this hotel if you are a very heavy sleeper. My teenage children slept through all the sirens and honking from the fire engines and ambulances from the station across the street, but I always heard them leaving and returning throughout the night. The front desk will supply you with ear plugs, but that didn't make a difference.
As for the room - we ended having a closet door removed because of a broken mirror. There were black scuff marks on the wall paper and the covers on the baseboard heaters were bent out of shape in several areas.
We had a corner suite with a kitchen, full size fridge, dining area, microwave, 2 cooking units with dishes and utensils and a few cooking supplies. There was a flat screen TV in the living area and bedroom. It was a very large suite considering we were in the middle of downtown Chicago.
Breakfast in the morning was ok. Lots of bagels, toast, muffins, juice, fruit, coffee and tea. I don't recommend the perfectly shaped round rubber eggs nor the biscuit.

"This is the most confronting documentary I have ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. Based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centred around the modern industrial growth of China, Edward Burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore.Taking no political sides, this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to educate us about - the by-products of economical growth, the externalities paid by citizens of the lesser-developed communities, the source of our comforts and the wastes of our consumer lifestyles.Amazing, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore.

"I stayed at this hotel on business for a few days in May 2008 and I really enjoyed my stay. Upon arriving, my room was not ready yet since I got there rather early, and the front desk person was super helpful and arranged for my bags to be stored and took my cell phone number to alert me when my room was ready. He also recommended a place around the corner for lunch which was very good. I was barely through my lunch and he called to let me know my room was ready, it was very quick. I was impressed because being cynical, I did not expect anyone to call, but they did, and very promptly and politely I should add!
So I returned to the hotel after lunch and retrived my bags and finished checking in. My room was at the end of a long corridor and faced the rear of the hotel. The room was really nice, I enjoyed it. My two ""complaints"", and I wouldn't even call them that, were the noise of the ""El"" train, even though i was on the 20th floor, I still heard it loud and clear every few minutes - it sounded like a strong wind blowing, that is what kept coming to mind. It didn't interrupt my sleep but I can see how it would effect some people's sleep overall. I found it soothing because I like ""white noise"" when I sleep. But, I wish now that I had asked for a front-facing room (those cost more I think, however). My other issue was the bathroom door which is set up to automatically close - it cannot stay open on its own. It's annoying! A colleague who was also staying at the hotel said she rigged it by opening it all the way and then opening the closet door so that the bathroom door could not close. I did this too and it helped - of course I closed the door when I needed to, but also I was in the room alone so I wanted to shower with the door open to relieve the steam. Lastly, speaking of the shower, and maybe this is just me, I had no idea how to turn it on, ha! I thought you would just turn the handle and the water would come on, but on this one you have to PULL the handle out and then turn. It did not say this anywhere so I thought the handle was broken and actually called maintenance - I was embarassed when they told me I simply had to pull the handle first. It sounded like they had heard this before, or at least I am going to tell myself that!
Overall, a beautiful hotel with a friendly staff, in a great location in Chicago's Loop. Lots of little cafes and stores nearby - convenient for little necessities or sundries. I would absolutely stay there again without hesitation!",positive,en

"One of my favourite spots for beer in Montreal. An ever changing menu (picked from the best local breweries), good food, and a great atmosphere make this place a sure-bet for a good time.\n\nThe beer menu is usually around 30-40 beers, and written on a blackboard (it changes daily). With beers from MTL, Dieu Du Ciel, and other big local names, you just can't go wrong. There's always a few strange/fruity ones on there, as well as a cider or two, so there's guaranteed to be something for everyone. You can also get smaller 'taster' sized glasses, which is great for trying a large number of beers (and still being able to walk)\n\nThe back patio section is now open, but I haven't had a chance to try it myself. The place itself is alongside a public park, which gives it a look of plenty of space out the back.",positive,en

We had a small mix up with out reservation at checkin, but the front desk compensated us very graciously for this mistake.

"My trip started poorly when my flight got canceled because of maintenance issues and I had to spend six hours in the airport. Arrived in El Paso late, and when I checked in the staff at the check-in counter told me they did not have the room that I had reserved available (king size bed), but they were willing to give me a complimentary upgrade to a room. Intriguing... Then the other shoe dropped. The ""upgraded room"" was a two double size beds. I told her the ""upgrade"" sure didn't seem like an upgrade, and that I preferred a room with a king size bed. As if it were almost scripted she said, ""but it is a very spacious room."" I stood my ground and she miraculously found a king size room, but it was a handicapped room. She said, ""the big drawback is there is no tub."" I can't remember the last time I soaked in a bathtub. She gave me the key to the room, and off I went. Not a big deal, but it almost seemed like she didn't want me in the king size room.
In regards to the hotel, the property is pretty dated and the rooms show signs of wear and tear after 20 years. My room is extremely large and comfortable. In spite of being next door to the airport, you can barely hear the planes coming and going. Many restaurants are within walking distance. I didn't mind the sleep number bed, but I was exhausted.

"I just came home from this place and I can finally say I have found my permanent ramen place in Vegas! Upon entering the small restaurant, the environment felt very welcoming which is important to me. \n\nI ordered a bowl of miso ramen, while my boyfriend ordered the shio ramen. It took only about 5 minutes for our two bowls of hot ramen to arrive at our table. From the moment my ramen touched the table I could smell the delicious chashu pork and hearty broth. The chashu pork was very flavorful and soft compared to some ramen places I've been to where its been chewy and dry. The noodles were a little thick and slightly chewy, but well cooked. Both of us were very satisfied with our meal and definitely will come back again.\n\nTips: For those who have a preference for a more subtle taste , order the shio. It is very light and not too salty or too overwhelming for flavor. The miso on the other hand is loaded with flavor, so choose wisely!",positive,en

"The quote I used for my summary occurs about halfway through THE GOOD EARTH, as a captain of a Chinese revolutionary army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot MORE of the looters among them, as his unit has just been called back to the front lines. Of course, the next looter about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film, the former kitchen slave girl O-Lan (for whose portrayal Luise Rainer, now 99-years-old, won her second consecutive best actress Oscar).The next scene finds O-Lan dutifully delivering her bag of looted jewels to her under-appreciative husband, farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni), setting in motion that classic dichotomy of a man's upward financial mobility being the direct inverse of his moral decline.For a movie dealing with subject matter including slavery, false accusations, misogyny, starvation, home invasion, eating family pets, mental retardation, infanticide, exploited refugees, riots, civil war, summary mass street executions, bigamy, child-beating, adultery, incest, and insect plagues of biblical proportions, THE GOOD EARTH is a surprisingly heart-warming movie.My parting thought is in the form of another classic quote, from O-Lan herself (while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband Wang Lung had angrily tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their hut): ""Meat is meat.""",positive,en

"We stayed here 2 nights in September for a wedding. I've stayed here before and I am always very happy with the service, this time was no different. I admit that there may be better places to stay in the city, certainly the parking is atrocious and you will pay $50 a day to park your car there, but that is San Francisco. I had an ulterior motive for staying here: shopping! But that is the beauty of this hotel, you can make many, many trips to the mall on foot. Shop in the morning, bring your loot back to the hotel, take a break, go back at it...well you get the idea. And the shopping was fabulous, so much so that now I probably can't afford this hotel as all of my money is wrapped up in my new winter boots. Rooms are updated and clean, I like the green option at this westin, choosing not to clean your room will get you $5 a day or 500 spg points. Our room was overlooking a church, and I actually liked hearing the churchbells in the morning but realize that may not be for everyone. The other bonus, their gym is AMAZING. Maybe it's because I work out at a pit at home, but I loved this gym! Everything was new, which made working out more fun, and who doesn't like a fun workout?! Overall, this is a very good hotel in the city, a cab ride away from anything you might want to do.

"The restaurant has a variety of dishes on their menu, but their main attraction is the pork ribs. If you have been to both the restaurants in Bali (Ubud & Seminyak), you will soon realize that the ribs here taste way better.

Other dishes are equally delicious, for example, the sup buntut, maggie goreng and also their duck confit-asian style are just some of the must try. The price is reasonable for the portion and the flavours. It is great because you get to have a piece of Bali. Service is also excellent.

"We stayed at the Drury Plaza on a recent trip to San Antonio. We absolutely loved everything about it. We had booked a standard 2 queen room through hotels.com. We received a very good rate that averaged about 120.00 a night.
Rooms--Our room was located in the older section that was once the bank building. We had a huge corner room. It had six windows and we could see most of San Antonio including the riverwalk. Although the carpet seemed to be worn, the bathroom appeared to be newly remodeled. The beds were extremely comfortable and had a pillow-top type mattress. Yes the rooms were in an older section, but in our opinion the fact that they were older and historical were what gave them character.
Location--This hotel was within 20 minutes of the airport, right on the riverwalk, and within walking distance of any location in downtown San Antonio.
Food--The free breakfast and kickback were good for what we needed them for. The breakfast kept us full until lunch and the kickback was a good appetizer for dinner.
Staff--There was not one person we encountered either in the hotel or in the city who were not polite, friendly, and helpful.
We would recommend this hotel with flying colors and will definitely stay here again on our next visit to San Antonio.",positive,en

"Having not seen this film in about 20 years I am still impressed with it 's hard -hitting impact and stellar acting.

I love the Mick's last line before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning.(I think the Stranglers lifted it for a line in one of their songs-Get a Grip on Yourself.)This is a great film and unjustly buried film. Let's get it out ! Side note-a recent Film Review magazine gave a big write up on Don Segal's ""Babyface Nelson"" ,made a couple years before ""Last Mile"" and also starring Mickey Rooney. Another rave of the Mick's intense and sympathetic performance.Perhaps it's the start of a groundswell of a appreciation for some truly superior cinematic performances.",positive,en
"Wohoo, Sales! This is not the biggest strenght of MEC, of course, but when it happen, it's not that much advertised but if you're looking at the right place, at the right momen, you're golden! MEC is most likely one of my favorite place to shop. In my top 4 for sure. I like books,music, traveling, outdoors' activities, cooking and eating. There's at lest 2 things that this store will help me with: Traveling and outdoor: Buying the good gear makes your life easier. Plus I don't like spending my money in stuff that suck. So here I am, going in to try the Trail Glove Merrell Barefoot shoes - which fit my large feet, yes!!! - but i also found my Gregory Mywok 22 liter Gourd-Bag. Regular price: 115$ yeah I know, not cheap, but got it for 79$! One thing i've noticed since the last time I went is that the way the store is now, is a bit different from last time and that they have way more paleo supplement, dry food. The store is just so ridiculously big. It takes a big chunk of your day if you want to explore the store in full. \n\nTant mieux , des ventes! c'est pas la force de MEC, mais quand on regarde attentivement et qu'on cherche comme il faut on peut tomber sur de bonnes aubaines. C'est pas mal dans mes meilleures places pour magasiner. J'aime lire, la musique, le plein air et voyage, cuisiner et manger. Je peux m'\u00e9quip\u00e9 comme un chef pour avoir un quotidien plus facile et agr\u00e9able. Je me suis achet\u00e9 un sac-gourde Gregory qui vaut 115$ a 79$ m\u00e9chante bonne aubaine! C'est vraiment un bon sac, 22 litres, avec gourde jusqu'a 3 litres. C'Est vraiment parce que j'n'avais pas de sac pour mettre mon lunch au d\u00e9but mais je dois admettre que \u00e7a a vraiment rendu le transport des bidules du quotidien plus agr\u00e9able. Voyez-vous certains dudes sont du genre sacoche d'homme ou porte-feuille, moi c'est Sac-\u00e0-dos! Et y commence (enfin on vas esp\u00e9rer) \u00e0 faire chaud, donc la gourde est primordial pour rester hydrater dans les chaudes journ\u00e9e d'\u00e9t\u00e9s!. \n\nIls ont un peu chang\u00e9 la structure du magasin vs la derni\u00e8re fois o\u00f9 j'y suis all\u00e9 mais c'est bien organiser. Ils ont beaucoup augmenter le stock de nourriture de camping aussi je trouve. Enfin, un must pour le magasin de plein air. \n\nPS: Les mauvaises critiques sur le magasin ne justifie certainement pas d'avoir \u00e0 faire du bashing sur la location. une personne a maltrait\u00e9 la location qui est au march\u00e9 central. Soit, c'est nul y aller en bus ou \u00e0 pied ou en m\u00e9tro, mais c'est loin d'\u00eatre au milieu de nullepart.",positive,en

"Visiting Vegas anytime soon???? Leave the $9.99 rib-eye specials @ the strip. This place is worth the ride. KoMex is a small, quaint, family-run dive. But, your taste buds and wallet will thank you. We took a taxi(not recommended unless you schedule them to pick you back up) Nevertheless, we waited happily for 30 minutes chatting up on how great this meal was. In the end, taxi never showed and the owner Linda graciously offered us a ride back to our hotel. I've never rated on yelp before and this may just be the beginning of more to come. KoMex will be tough to beat on budget and value. I see a bright future ahead for these folks. THANKS AGAIN!",positive,en
"We first tried this place for the $30 restaurant week meal. The service was the best service I've ever had anywhere in Las Vegas and the food was great, but not without flaws here and there. We both enjoyed grumpy's salad (like a wedge salad but already chopped up for you!) and my trout was spectacular. My husband got the steak and it was pretty bad - chewy and nothing special. Dessert was beautifully presented and tasty (a chocolate flourless cake if memory serves). Overall a 4, but not a 5 star dinner. It was $30, however, and it WAS restaurant week, so I went back a few weeks ago determined to have the 5 star evening I was determined Todd's could deliver! \n\nTodd's had sent out an email about how they were one of a few restaurants to get one of the first early shipments of King Crabs this year. I'm a huge crab freak, so I was more than eager to try them. They were sold in 2 or 3 lb dinners at market price ($65ish if memory serves). My husband and I shared this and it was TONS of crab. My husband's family is from Maryland my family is from New Orleans so we're pretty big on crab. Most of the buffet crabs here I find pretty disgusting, and I was eager to have a crab dinner that lived up to my standards! The crab here was phenomenal. I've had king crab many times before but this was by far the best I'd ever had. This crab was fresh off the boat (just 2 days before!) and had never been frozen. Flavor and texture was flawless. I never thought I'd eat the best crab in my life in freaking Henderson, NV, but this happens to be the case !\n\nOther than the mediocre steak during restaurant week, everything about this place has been flawless over our 2 visits. The decor is very dated, but the service and food more than make up for it!",positive,en

But otherwise the flight was great (well as good as a long uncomfortable flight can be), service is always with a smile and everything went according to plan.",positive,en

"This was my second trip to Chicago for a ""girls getaway"", but my first time at this hotel. The location was good, as it is more centrally located to common attractions, and only a very short walk to the bus stop. However, I was disappointed that there was a $25 restocking fee for the refrigerator that was in the room, and a $20 fee if we wanted a refrigerator brought to the room to use. There was also a fee for the internet. For the price that we paid for the room, I would have thought these items would be included. The bathroom was tiny, and the sink/mirror was located inside the bathroom, meaning only one person could get ready at a time. The first day we were there we had an issue with our air conditioning. It ran all day and night, but wasn't blowing out cold air. Finally after turning it off and on, it began to blow out cold, but then stayed ice cold even after turning the thermostat up. (We were going to report it, but once it started blowing out cold air we were happy, so we didn't feel it was anything to complain about.) The fan on the AC was noisy, but it blocked out city noises. The hotel is next to a busy hospital, and there were constant sirens, but we were on the 33rd floor, so noise was not really an issue for us, but probably is on the lower floors. We did not eat in either restaurant because the prices were quite high. We noticed the price of the breakfast buffet was $17.95 per person, and I cannot imagine eating enough food to make it worth that price. On the plus side, the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, and the best part of our stay. The staff was wonderful and very friendly and helpful. Overall, it was a nice clean hotel, but nothing fancy. The location was good for shopping, (but not much of a view), and I assume that is what we were paying for, as there were no amenities included. The less expensive (and just as nice) hotel that I stayed in last year included a refrigerator and free internet and we were directly across from Grant Park, so I would probably choose that location next time instead of this one.",positive,en

"One of my favorite places to get away and just experience nature. The preserve encompasses 17,000 acres, and the city is working to add thousands more acres in the next few years. Residents of the northeast part of Scottsdale and Fountain Hills are blessed with sweeping views of the McDowell Mountains every day. I am lucky enough to live in a neighborhood that borders the preserve, and try to take short hikes as often as possible.\n\nThe easiest way to access the preserve is via the Gateway Trailhead. Located off Thompson Peak, it provides ample parking and a very upscale visitor's center with clean bathrooms and maps. During peak times, volunteers are there to answer your questions and guide you on the appropriate trails.\n\nA good introduction to the preserve is the Gateway Loop Trail, a moderate hike of 4.4 miles. The trail leads up to a saddle and then back down. I typically take the trail clockwise, so I encounter the steeper part first (1.7 miles up to the saddle). Great for trailrunners and mountain bikers, although parts of the incline are quite rocky. The Gateway Loop Trail offers access to the Bell Pass Trail and Windgate Pass Trail. I would recommend the Gateway Loop Trail to those in moderate shape. The flatter trails closer to the Gateway Trailhead, such as the Saguaro Loop Trail, are better for those out of shape or new to hiking. \n\nHere's a basic map of the trails in the preserve:\n <url> Tom's Thumb trailhead is currently understand construction, and the Brown's Ranch Trailhead will begin construction in 2012. If you want to check out the trails at Brown's Ranch before the new trailhead opens, just head east on Dynamite from Pima and turn left on Alma School Road. Follow it until it ends and park. You can navigate using the power lines, rock piles, and Brown and Cone Mountains. Here's a link to the current map offered by the city:\n <url>",positive,en

"This is a very nice hotel - a beautiful renovation in a city that needs good service and a good reputation - but we were extremely disappointed with our stay.
We had two incidents during our stay. The first was that a male staff member entered our room without knocking while we were in the room. The second incident was that our GPS system was stolen out of our glove compartment in our car. The valet service offered to replace the GPS, which was unexpected and appreciated. However, that does not change the fact that we can never trust the valets at this hotel and thus I am disappointed to say that we will never stay at this hotel again or recommend it to anyone.
What is most unfortunate is that this is about more than a room intruder and a stolen GPS. This is about the resurgence of Detroit. I have family in Grosse Pointe and am often in the area. My family and I are big fans of the D and are pulling for the city to shine again. I chose a night at the Westin as a 35th birthday gift to my husband (which was a major expense for me) and what was supposed to be a relaxing, rejuvenating night ended up being fraught with discomfort and disappointment. We are advocates for Detroit but how are we supposed to encourage our friends and family to spend time there if this was our experience? We simply cannot. And that makes me genuinely sad.",positive,en
"We were a group (6 couples) - first time visit to Chicago and chose to stay at the Palmer House. The hotel is in an excellent location, within walking distance to most major sites in the city. Originally we were booked in at the Drake, but found a great price, through Priceline.com . We called the hotel directly, tried Hilton Honours rates, but the best deal was through priceline.
The Palmer House is grand old beautiful hotel, and as most state on TripAdvisor, the rooms are quite small. All we were looking for was: location, comfortable, clean rooms. We were not disappointed.
A couple of helpful hints for first timers.
- shop around for prices, priceline was a huge savings.
- if you're coming from O'Hare, take the BlueLine subway. It's only $2.25, takes 40 minutes and get off at Monroe. The hotel is really close to the subway stop. Easy travelling both ways!
- if you are staying for a few days, get a day, 3 day or 7 day transit pass. The subway system is fantastic.
- 7th Floor is the business center. No charge to use. Print off your boarding passes in advance.
- The hotel is in the financial district, so it is quieter at night, but a lot of great restaurants and Jazz bars, short taxi ride away.
- Breakfast / coffee at the Corner Bakery restaurant (right beside the hotel) is great!
- There is a charge to use the Fitness /workout facilities, but no charge for the indoor pool.
- The original Chocolate Brownie (recipe) was created at the Palmer House (early 1900's). For a late night dessert try one in the lobby bar. Fantastic! Ask at the concierge and they will give you a copy of the recipe.
- drinks in the hotel $$$ !
- Chicago architecture boat tour was amazing. Very informative, gave great insight on the history of Chicago, and a excellent way to see the city and get your bearings.
Chicago, you have a very beautiful city. We will be back!",positive,en

"The hotels room come with a small kitchen that has a fridge, microwave, stove, dishwasher, and a toaster. The beds are very comfortable. Bathrooms are also decent. Nice touch is the sofa and chair that matches with the decor. It is not a dull room. However the hotel is at a location where it is not safe to go out after 6pm/sunset.
The restaurants in the neigborhood all shut down around 7pm or so. So your option is to have dinner at the Courtyard or Starbucks both of which are attached to the hotel building. A better option is to buy some microwave ready (heat and eat) kind of food and store it in the refrigerator unless you are a non-veg and can hit the social hour in the hotel lobby.
Hotel has buffet breakfast (fruit, bagels, breads, eggs, meats, and waffles) that is complimentary/self serve. Breakfast options are semi-decent. The only thing I would recoomend the hotel staff is to put couple more toasters - one to serve 40 to 50 people at peak time is not sufficient. They also have a evening social hour with some food, beer, juices, soda, and wine (all complimentary). If one is a non-veg, they can make a dinner out of this and don't have to worry about going out. Veg folks are out of luck - salad and some hamburger buns are what is uusally there. Hotel needs to start catering to the needs of the veg folks and veg means more than salad, This is my 2nd 10 day stay here and I have only seen veg option once (not too great looking). I would think they can have a lot of veg options and the simplest one might be cheese pizza or being in texas - tacos with beans.
Front desk folks greet you very well but it would be better if they understand the needs of their guests a bit better. The shuttle service could be a bit more frequent. It would be nice if the front desk can telll the travller when the shuttle would arrive rather than asking the travller to check around the corner. If this was a public shuttle, I would understand. But this is the hotel run shuttle.
Overall I think this is an OK place but with some improvements, it could be a desirable place to stay.",positive,en

"So after I finished reading Burn for Me, the first book in Ilona Andrews&#8217; new and AMAZING Hidden Legacy series, I got to talking with another Ilona fan, who had been told that the world-building in Burn for Me was similar to the worlds in the Kinsmen series and the novella, Of Swine and Roses.And I was like, &#8220;Huh. I can see that.&#8221; But it&#8217;d been years since my early OMG-I-LOVE-Ilona binge, so I decided a reread was in order.And here we are.Some time in the indeterminate future, when space colonization was the new Big Thing, humans began to genetically enhance themselves. They needed to be stronger, faster, heartier, more versatile. Some of these enhancements were tech-based, effecting only the individual, and some were biological, being inherited by offspring.&#34;It was quickly realized that the advantage of these biological enhancements lay in their exclusivity. Thus, the biologically enhanced united and shut down all further biological modification.&#34;And consolidated their power. They were called the Kinsmen, and to maintain both the potency and exclusivity of their enhanced blood, the families arranged marriages for their children based on bloodlines and business alliances.This is why Meli Galdes was betrothed to Celino Carvanna when she was 10 years old and he was 16.While neither of them was happy with the arrangement, Meli accepted it, but Celino did NOT. He worked the next 6 years to make himself indispensable to his family, and worth more as an individual than the alliance with the Galdes family.And he succeeded.But where did that leave Meli?An excellent question. And one you will only get the answer to by . . . wait for it . . . yes, that&#8217;s right&#8212;READING the book. *winsome face*Verdict: a quick, fun, and SEXY read. Yes, I know it&#8217;s Ilona Andrews, and yes, I know that fabulous as she is, she&#8217;s not particularly well known for sexy times, but there&#8217;s a first for everything, right?

If you like quiet, make sure you stay on a lower floor. I am sure they could have moved me had I asked, but that was the last thing I wanted to do at 10:30 PM.

As there were two of us in the room, we had to sit on the bed. We didn't have time to sample the hotel's amenities, such as restaurants or gym; we were out exploring the city.",positive,en
"Had a short vacation in Philly to see some friends a few days ago and stayed here at Hotel Palomar, the location is ideal, you're within walking distance of many attractions. The staff is very welcoming and nice and is willing to give advice on places to go and sorts. Definitely staying here next time we are in town!",positive,en
"My parents and I stayed in a 3-person room, with one double and one twin bed, for 2 nights. The room was rather small, but we were prepared for it. There was air-conditioning, which was great to protect us from the 90+ temperatures outside. The ensuite bathroom was convenient, and the shower worked fine. Towels and bedlinen were changed as expected. At $135 a night (before tax), the price was OK for mid-June.
Hotel 31 is situated very close to the Empire State Building, and 15 minutes walk from Times Square. This was excellent, as we could explore all of midtown Manhattan on foot within a couple of hours.
There was one problem: the elevator within the building stopped working for at least 45 minutes on the morning of the second day, so my parents and I had to walk up 6 storeys to our room. Luckily the (tiny) elevator was walking when we checked in and checked out, so we didn't have to carry our luggage up and down.
The front-desk people were helpful, and recommended a good diner for breakfast.",positive,en
"It is extremely difficult finding a honest, knowledgeable, reasonably priced mechanic. You will usually get one out of the three with most being dishonest, money hungry scavengers trying to fulfill a quota, IMO. Highline has been and continues to be an awesome experience each time. Strange for an Auto Shop right? I was referred to Highline Auto by a fellow Officer after I shared how I went to Midas and was advised that they were unable to do my oil change because the oil pan or cap was damaged? Or they couldn't unscrew it? Confusing right? It should be noted I went in with a coupon for a $16.99 oil change. I am now sure that this was the ticket to get me in the door, to be followed by a super duper up sale on items I didn't need. Suffice to say, I then took my car to Wes, didn't mention what happened at Midas and he proceeded to change my oil without a hitch! That set the tone and I have been taking my car to Highline Auto ever since. Highline doesn't need coupons. Wes and his mechanics treat you fairly, are knowledgeable, honest and friendly. You just can't beat that in this day and age! Highly Recommended",positive,en

"i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner. \n\ni work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week. \n\ni ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting) \nmy coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top. \n\nmine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.\n\nthe next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita.\n\nthe next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio. \n\nand the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount! \n\ntoday i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms.\n\n\ni love this place!",positive,en
"Love these pillows. Solved my neck pain and headaches.
These pillows arrived in a compressed bag. Once I took them out, they were the perfect size for our king size pillow cases. These pillows have practically soft my neck problems. They form perfectly to my head and they were extremely affordable compared to department store pillows. It seems like their quality is equal to 100$ pillows.",positive,en

"My daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights on our first trip to San Francisco. We arrived just before 1pm but were advised that our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm. That is the official check in time so understandable but after flying from Aus we just wanted a shower! Our bags were stored for us and we went for a walk around for a while and when we returned reception asked if we would like to use the business centre so we were able to send emails home while we waited for our room to be ready. Our room was a good size with 2 comfortable queen size beds. The wardrobe appeared to be a door to an adjoining room so I am wondering if a previous reviewer missed this and thought there was no wardrobe. All staff including our cleaner were very helpful and friendly. The location of the hotel is brilliant. So many diners, restaurants and shops nearby. We caught the streetcars on Market st to pretty much everywhere we needed to go for only $2. The only issue with the hotel was the noise! We had a Powell St facing room and I had very little sleep over the 4 nights. The cable cars stop at midnight and we didn't get to bed before then so they weren't a problem but the street noise from people and cars goes on through the night as does the construction work across the road - they were hammering floorboards etc right through the night and it sounded as though they were in the room with us. This was my only complaint and not something the hotel can do anything about.",positive,en
"Love them but will stain
These are very durable, handle being hand washed and dishwasher cleaned well (haven't but into washing machine out of inconvenience). The patterns are super cute also and they significantly reduce the number of disposable baggies I use. I put Cheez-its in the confetti pattern bag and the zipper fabric stained during the morning, I'm very disappointed in that but they are still great baggies for all ages.",positive,en
"Best expereince of my life!! Me and my husband have made it a thing to go to a show everytime we go to vegas. Weve seen quite a few of shows but blue man group takes the cake. We purchased our tickets from those trucks on the strip tix 4 tonight. We got a really good deal. 120 for 2 tickets and the seats were perfect. I recommend this to everyone. It really is magnificant. There are no words to describe it you just have to go. Its lively, its fun, and youll be talking about it forever. Great for kids too. \n\nLike 10 minutes before the show, they do this mini show around the casino and stops at the theatre. Its really wonderful i really have no words for it just go and see for yourself.",positive,en
"During my week in Chicago I stayed at 3 different Hotels in different areas of Chicago. The Allegro Hotel was the only disappointment during the entire trip.
Before I made reservations, I called the hotel and asked if the rooms were large enough for 3 people to fit comfortably and the answer was yes, definately. I booked the room for 4 people and even paid a little extra - $249.00 per night thinking that I would get a larger rooms/suites. Let me tell you how small my room was - 2 double beds tight up against each wall with a 3 1/2 ' desk/nightstand in between the beds. The room also had only a 19"" TV in an armoire. Very, very small bathroom, pedestal sink - with a small shelf above with hardly any room to put makeup or toiletries.
This room was described as being ""art deco"" and it really wasn't except for a couple lamps. It was just shabby and in need of some ""life"". The worst part - My room had a locked adjoining room door. This door was not sound proof at all. I constantly heard my neighbors TV or their conversations and could even heard them using the bathroom and the loud flush of their toilet. I had to leave my TV on low vaolume all night long just to drown out the noise.
Somehow my room didn't get cleaned during my 2 night stay - that was OK though since my expectations were now so low. We made our own beds and just requested towels and toiletries.
To be fair, the hotel is clean, in a fun area and has pleasant employees. It has a grand lobby, restaurant and wine/beer reception. However, I don't get too many vacations and when I do I want what I asked for and paid for. I found this hotel a big disappointment.",positive,en

"For what we would pay for a regular room in a more ""upscale"" chain, we had a king suite, with lots of room. It would easily and comfortably accomodate a couple with one or two kids. The location was perfect; lots to do. The hotel is well done, with lots of attention to the decor and furnishings. We ate one breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the food was very good. We noted that some people complained about noise from next door rooms but we heard nothing at all (and the hotel was busy). We had a room on the main street and also did not think it was noisy (the windows provide good sound proofing). Not just a good value but a good hotel.",positive,en

"Been to Cibo many times! Beautiful historic house, consistently great service, best pizza in the Valley. We have long-debated whether Cibo surpassed Bianco, but I no longer question that it does. Cibo is best, and reasonably priced and delicious. The burrata is also the best I have ever had, and I highly recommend it. It is extremely creamy, but holds together very well, and the balsamic drizzled across the top is phenomenal.",positive,en
